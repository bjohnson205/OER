<article class="paragraphs"><p>The London Eye is a huge Ferris wheel located on the South Bank of the River Thames in London, England. It is 135 meters (443 feet) tall and completes one full rotation every 30 minutes. If we look at the behavior of one of the wheel's passenger capsules, we see that it completes one cycle, or one revolution, and then repeats this revolution over and over again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The motion of this Ferris wheel is an example of a periodic function because its revolution or cycle is repeated every 30 minutes, and so we say that it has a period of 30 minutes.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="periodic-functions.html#paragraphs-9">in-context</a></span>
