<p>Remember that these values correspond to the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle of 2.5 radians. To determine approximately where this is on the unit circle, we can find decimal approximations of a few common angles on the unit circle. Since \(\pi/2\) is approximately 1.57 and \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14, 2.5 radians is in between \(\pi/2\) radians and \(\pi\) radians. Therefore, 2.5 radians corresponds to a point on the unit circle in the second quadrant, and it makes sense that the cosine value or \(x\) coordinate is negative and the sine value or \(y\) coordinate is positive.</p>
