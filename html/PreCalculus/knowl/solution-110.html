<p>Looking at \(f(x)\text{,}\) we see that the highest power of \(x\) is \(2\text{,}\) so the degree is \(2\text{.}\) The term with the highest degree is \(3x^2\text{,}\) meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is \(3\text{,}\) which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
<p>Looking at \(g(x)\text{,}\) we see that the highest power of \(x\) is \(24\text{,}\) so the degree is \(24\text{.}\) The term with the highest degree is \(15x^{24}\text{,}\) meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is \(15\text{,}\) which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
<p>Looking at \(h(x)\text{,}\) we see that the polynomial is not arranged in descending order of degree, so we will rearrange first.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h(x)=17x^3+11x^2+121x
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now we see that the highest power of \(x\) is \(3\text{,}\) so the degree is \(3\text{.}\) The term with the highest degree is \(17x^{3}\text{,}\) meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is \(17\text{,}\) which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
<p>Looking at \(j(x)\text{,}\) we see that the polynomial is not arranged in descending order of degree, so we will rearrange first.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
j(x)=5x^3+4x^3+2x+3x+5=9x^3+5x+5
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now we see that the highest power of \(x\) is \(3\text{,}\) so the degree is \(3\text{.}\) The term with the highest degree is \(9x^{3}\text{,}\) meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is \(9\text{,}\) which means this is our leading coefficient.</p>
<p>Looking at \(k(x)\text{,}\) we have just a constant. This is the same as \(k(x)=25\cdot 1=25x^0\text{,}\) so we see that the highest power of \(x\) is \(0\text{,}\) so the degree is \(0\text{.}\) The term with the highest degree is \(25x^0=25\text{,}\) meaning this is our leading term, and the coefficient of this term is \(25\text{,}\) which means this is our leading coefficient.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="Algebra-of-Functions.html#solution-110">in-context</a></span>
