<title>The Borda Count and the Majority Criterion</title>

<subsection><title>The Borda Count</title>
	<p>Our first method of ranked voting is called the Borda Count. Its rules are fairly easy to state.</p>
	<biographical>
		<p>The Borda Count is named for Jean-Charles de Borda, a French mathematician, scientist, and naval engineer who developed this system in 1770. He also helped fight in the American Revolutionary War, during which he was briefly held captive by the British. His name is one of 72 inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.</p>

	<assemblage><title>The Borda Count</title>
		<p>The <term>Borda Count</term> method of voting assigns points to candidates. Each candidate earns 1 point for every voter that ranked them last, 2 points for every voter that ranked them second-to-last, and so on. After adding up each candidate's total points, the candidate with the most points wins.

	</assemblage>

Let's illustrate it with an example.

<example xml:id="eg-borda">
	<p>
		Find the Borda Count winner of the election whose preference table is below.
	</p>

	<table><caption></caption>
	<tabular top="none" bottom="minor" left="minor" right="minor">

			<cell>D</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>B</cell>
		</row>
		<row>

    	<cell right="medium">2nd choice</cell>

			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>A</cell>
			<cell>A</cell>
			<cell>A</cell>
		</row>
	</tabular>
	</table>

	<p>
		Notice that we have added a column to the left of the preference schedule indicating how many Borda points are awarded to each ranking. Since there are 4 candidates, a first-place ranking is worth 4 points.
	</p>

	<p>
		To find the score of Candidate A, we look at the four times A appears on the preference table. The first column says that 6 people ranked A first, giving A <m>6(4)=24</m> points. Everyone else ranked A last, giving A 1 point each. This adds up to <m>5+4+2=11</m> points. Therefore, A has a total of <m>24+11=35</m> points.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can calculate the Borda points of the other candidates similarly, as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>B: <m>6(3) +5(3) +4(2) +2(4) =49</m></li>
			<li>C: <m>6(1) +5(2) +4(4) +2(3) =38</m></li>
			<li>D: <m>6(2) +5(4) +4(3) +2(2) =48</m></li>
		</ul>
		Thus, Candidate B wins this election when the Borda Count is used.
	</p>
</example>

<p>
	Notice that the plurality winner of the election in <xref ref="eg-borda"/> was Candidate A, with 6 votes out of 17 (about 35%). Candidate B had only 2 first-choice votes, but many others ranked B second. In contrast, Candidate A was ranked last by everyone other than the 6 who ranked A first. We could say that B is a consensus or compromise candidate, while A is a more polarizing figure.
