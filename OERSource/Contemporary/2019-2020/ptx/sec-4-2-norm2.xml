<title>The Normal Distribution Part II</title>

<subsection><title>The mean and standard deviation of <m>\overline{x}</m></title>

<p>If bags of chips are produced with an average weight of 15 oz and a standard deviation of 0.1 oz, what is the probability that the average weight of 30 bags will be within 0.1 oz of the mean? The answer is not 68%! To answer this question we must visualize and understand what is called the sampling distribution of a sample mean.</p>

<p>It is not always reasonable to look at the entire population of data. Sometimes we need to take a sample. How do we know that a sample can tell us reliable information about a larger population?</p> 

<p> In this section we consider a data set which represents all 19,961 runners who finished the 2017 Cherry Blossom 10 mile run in Washington, DC. <fn>www.cherryblossom.org</fn>. Part of this data is shown in figure 4.7 and the variables are described in figure 4.8. </p>

<p>These data are special because they include the results for the entire population of runners who finished the 2017 Cherry Blossom Run. We took a simple random sample of 100 runners from this population, which is represented in Figure 4.9. A histogram summarizing the time variable in the sample data set is shown in Figure 4.10.</p>

<p> From the random sample represented in figure 4.9, we found the average time it takes to run 10 miles is 95.61 minutes. Suppose we take another random sample of 100 individuals and take its mean: 95.30 minutes. Suppose we took another (93.43 minutes) and another (94.16 minutes), and so on. If we do this many many times – which we can do only because we have the entire population data set – we can build up a <term>sampling distribution</term> for the sample mean when the sample size is 100, shown in Figure 4.11</p>

<assemblage> 
	<title>Sampling Distribution</title>
	<p>The sampling distribution represents the distribution of the point estimates based on samples of a fixed size from a certain population. It is useful to think of a point estimate as being drawn from such a distribution. Understanding the concept of a sampling distribution is central to understanding statistical inference.</p>
</assemblage>

	<p>The sampling distribution shown in Figure 4.11 is unimodal and approximately symmetric. It is also centered exactly at the true population mean: <m>\mu</m> = 94.52. Intuitively, this makes sense. The sample mean should be an unbiased estimator of the population mean. Because we are considering the distribution of the sample mean, we will use <m>X</m> = 94.52 to describe the true mean of this distribution. </p>

<p>We can see that the sample mean has some variability around the population mean, which can be quantified using the standard deviation of this distribution of sample means. The standard deviation of the sample mean tells us how far the typical estimate is away from the actual population mean, 94.52 minutes. It also describes the typical <emph>error</emph> of a single estimate, and is denoted by the symbol <m>s</m></p>

<assemblage>
	<title>Standard deviation of an estimate</title>
	<p>The standard deviation associated with an estimate describes the typical error or uncertainty associated with the estimate.</p>
</assemblage>

<example>
	<p>Looking at figures 4.10 and 4.11, we see that the standard deviation of the sample mean with n = 100 is much smaller than the standard deviation of a single sample. Interpret this statement and explain why it is true.</p>

	<p>The variation from one sample mean to another sample mean is much smaller than the variation from one individual to another individual. This makes sense because when we average over 100 values, the large and small values tend to cancel each other out. While many individuals have a time under 90 minutes, it would be unlikely for the average of 100 runners to be less than 90 minutes.</p>
</example>

<example>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Would you rather use a small sample or a large sample when estimating a parameter? Why?</p>

		<p>Consider two random samples: one of size 10 and one of size 1000. Individual observations in the small sample are highly influential on the estimate while in larger samples these individual observations would more often average each other out. The larger sample would tend to provide a more accurate estimate.</p></li>

		<li><p>Using your reasoning from part 1, would you expect a point estimate based on a small sample to have smaller or larger standard deviation than a point estimate based on a larger sample?</p>

		<p>If we think an estimate is better, we probably mean it typically has less error. Based on part 1, our intuition suggests that a larger sample size corresponds to a smaller standard deviation.</p></li>
	</ol>
</example>

<p>We can calculate the standard deviation of the sample means using the following formula:</p>

<me> s = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} </me>

<p> where <m>\sigma</m> is the standard deviation of the parent population and <m>n</m> is the number of observations in the sample.</p>


<example>
	<p>The average of the runners’ ages is 35.05 years with a standard deviation of <m>\sigma</m> = 8.97. A simple random sample of 100 runners is taken.</p>

	<ol>
		<li><p>What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?</p>

		<p>Using the equation above, we find that <m>s = \frac{8.97}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{8.97}{10} = 0.897.</m></p></li>

		<li><p>Would you be surprised to get a sample of size 100 with an average of 36 years?</p>

		<p> It would not be surprising. 36 years is about 1 standard deviation from the true mean of 35.05. Based on the 68-95-99.7 rule, we would get a sample mean at least this far away from the true mean approximately 100% − 68% = 32% of the time.</p></li>
