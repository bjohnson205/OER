<title>Statistics and Population</title>


<subsection><title>Statistics</title>
	<p>Like most people, you probably feel that it is important to "take control of your life." But what does this mean? Partly it means being able to properly evaluate the data and claims that bombard you every day. If you cannot distinguish good from faulty reasoning, then you are vulnerable to manipulation and to decisions that are not in your best interest. Statistics provides tools that you need in order to react intelligently to information you hear or read. In this sense, Statistics is one of the most important things that you can study.</p>

<p>To be more specific, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)
	<ul>
		<li>4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.</li>
		<li>Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.</li>
		<li>Condoms are effective 94% of the time.</li>
		<li>Native Americans are significantly more likely to be hit crossing the streets than are people of other ethnicities.</li>
		<li>People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.</li>
		<li>Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.</li>
		<li>A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.</li>
		<li>People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.</li>
		<li>There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.</li>
		<li>79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>All of these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, we bet that you have heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Indeed, data and data-interpretation show up in discourse from virtually every facet of contemporary life.</p>

<p>Statistics are often presented in an effort to add credibility to an argument or advice. You can see this by paying attention to television advertisements. Many of the numbers thrown about in this way do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading, and push you into decisions that you might find cause to regret. For these reasons, learning about statistics is a long step towards taking control of your life. (It is not, of course, the only step needed for this purpose.)  These chapters will help you learn statistical essentials. It will make you into an intelligent consumer of statistical claims.</p>

<p>You can take the first step right away. To be an intelligent consumer of statistics, your first reflex must be to question the statistics that you encounter. The British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli famously said, "There are three kinds of lies -- lies, damned lies, and statistics." This quote reminds us why it is so important to understand statistics. So let us invite you to reform your statistical habits from now on. No longer will you blindly accept numbers or findings. Instead, you will begin to think about the numbers, their sources, and most importantly, the procedures used to generate them.</p>

<p>We have put the emphasis on defending ourselves against fraudulent claims wrapped up as statistics.  Just as important as detecting the deceptive use of statistics is the appreciation of the proper use of statistics.  You must also learn to recognize statistical evidence that supports a stated conclusion.  When a research team is testing a new treatment for a disease, statistics allows them to conclude based on a relatively small trial that there is good evidence their drug is effective.  Statistics allowed prosecutors in the 1950’s and 60’s to demonstrate racial bias existed in jury panels.  Statistics are all around you, sometimes used well, sometimes not. We must learn how to distinguish the two cases.</p>

<subsection><title>Populations and Samples</title>

	<p>Before we begin gathering and analyzing data we need to characterize the <b>population</b> we are studying. If we want to study the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical first-year college student, our population might be all first-year students at your college.  Or it might be:
		<ul>
			<li>All first-year community college students in the state of Washington.</li>
			<li>All first-year students at public colleges and universities in the state of Washington.</li>
			<li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the state of Washington.</li>
			<li>All first-year students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States. </li>
			<li>And so on.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

<assemblage>
	<title> Population </title>
	<p>The <term>population</term> of a study is the group the collected data is intended to describe.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>Sometimes the intended population is called the <term>target population</term>, since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.</p>

<p>Why is it important to specify the population?  We might get different answers to our question as we vary the population we are studying.  First-year students at the University of Washington might take slightly more diverse courses than those at your college, and some of these courses may require less popular textbooks that cost more; or, on the other hand, the University Bookstore might have a larger pool of used textbooks, reducing the cost of these books to the students.  Whichever the case (and it is likely that some combination of these and other factors are in play), the data we gather from your college will probably not be the same as that from the University of Washington.  Particularly when conveying our results to others, we want to be clear about the population we are describing with our data.</p>

<example>
	<p> A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article.
	What is the population?</p>

	<p>While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.</p>
</example>

<p>If we were able to gather data on every member of our population, say the average (we will define "average" more carefully in a subsequent section) amount of money spent on textbooks by each first-year student at your college during the 2009-2010 academic year, the resulting number would be called a <term>parameter</term>.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title> Parameter </title>
		<p> A <term>parameter</term> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using all the data from a population.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>We seldom see parameters, however, since surveying an entire population is usually very time-consuming and expensive, unless the population is very small or we already have the data collected.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title> Census </title>
		<p>A survey of an entire population is called a <term>census</term>.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>You are probably familiar with two common censuses: the official government Census that attempts to count the population of the U.S. every ten years, and voting, which asks the opinion of all eligible voters in a district.  The first of these demonstrates one additional problem with a census: the difficulty in finding and getting participation from everyone in a large population, which can bias, or skew, the results.</p>

<p>There are occasionally times when a census is appropriate, usually when the population is fairly small.  For example, if the manager of Starbucks wanted to know the average number of hours her employees worked last week, she should be able to pull up payroll records or ask each employee directly.</p>

<p>Since surveying an entire population is often impractical, we usually select a <term>sample</term> to study;</p>

<assemblage>
	<title> Sample </title>
		<p> A <term>sample</term> is a smaller subset of the entire population, ideally one that is fairly representative of the whole population.</p>
</assemblage>

<p>We will discuss sampling methods in greater detail in a later section.  For now, let us assume that samples are chosen in an appropriate manner.  If we survey a sample, say 100 first-year students at your college, and find the average amount of money spent by these students on textbooks, the resulting number is called a <term>statistic</term>.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title> Statistic </title>
		<p> A <term>statistic</term> is a value (average, percentage, etc.) calculated using the data from a sample.</p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="tacoma-mall">
	<p>A researcher wanted to know how citizens of Tacoma felt about a voter initiative.  To study this, she goes to the Tacoma Mall and randomly selects 500 shoppers and asks them their opinion.  60% indicate they are supportive of the initiative.  What is the sample and population?  Is the 60% value a parameter or a statistic?</p>

	<p>The sample is the 500 shoppers questioned.  The population is less clear.  While the intended population of this survey was Tacoma citizens, the effective population was mall shoppers.  There is no reason to assume that the 500 shoppers questioned would be representative of all Tacoma citizens.</p>

	<p>The 60% value was based on the sample, so it is a statistic.</p>
</example>

<exploration>
	<statement><p>To determine the average length of trout in a lake, researchers catch 20 fish and measure them.  What is the sample and population in this study?</p></statement>
	<solution><p>The sample is the 20 fish caught. The population is all fish in the lake.  The sample may be somewhat unrepresentative of the population since not all fish may be large enough to catch the bait.</p></solution>
</exploration>

<exploration>
	<statement><p>A college reports that the average age of their students is 28 years old.  Is this a statistic or a parameter?</p></statement>
	<solution><p>This is a parameter, since the college would have to data on all students (the population)</p></solution>

<subsection><title>Estimating Populations</title>

<introduction>
<p>
	Once we have sampled a population, there are many kinds of data we can examine. Here, we will discuss two kinds of surveys that can estimate population statistics.
</p>
</introduction>


<subsubsection><title>One-sample estimation</title>

<p>
	You are probably already familiar with our first type of survey, called <term>one-sample estimation</term>. We'll illustrate it using an example.
</p>

<example xml:id="tacoma-reprise">
	<p>
		Recall that in <xref ref="tacoma-mall"/>, a researcher surveyed 500 people in the Tacoma Mall. Of those 500 people, 60% said they supported a certain voter initiative. If the population of Tacoma is 200,000, then about how many of those people support this initiative?
	</p>
	<p>
		We don't know how accurate the sample is, but if we assume that these 500 people represent the city of Tacoma, then we can guess that about 60% of the whole city supports the initiative, too. Thus, we find 60% of 200,000:
		<me>(0.60)(200,000)=120,000.</me>
		So, we estimate that about 120,000 people in Tacoma support this voter initiative (provided that our sampling method was accurate).
	</p>
</example>

That's it! We can describe the steps of this method as follows.

<assemblage>
<p>
	We can use <term>one-sample estimation</term> to estimate the size of a smaller subpopulation within a larger population. Suppose that the overall population has <m>P</m> members and the subpopulation of interest has <m>N</m> members. We already know the value of <m>P</m>; we can find <m>N</m> as follows.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, take one sample from the overall population, and count how many members of the sample are part of the subpopulation of interest. Call that number <m>k</m>.</li>
	<li>Suppose the sample has <m>S</m> members. Find the proportion of the sample that is also in the subpopulation: that is, <m>k/S</m>.</li>
	<li>Multiply the proportion, <m>k/S</m>, by the total population, <m>P</m>, to estimate the value of <m>N</m>, the total number of members of the subpopulation.</li>
</ol>
</assemblage>

<p>
	Notice that the key assumption of one-sample estimation occurs in the last step above: <em>we assume that the subpopulation is the same proportion of the sample as it is of the overall population.</em> In the case of <xref ref="tacoma-reprise"/>, this means that we assumed that because 60% of the people we interviewed supported the initiative, about 60% of the whole city probably supports the initiative, too. This assumption depends strongly on the quality of our sample, which we will discuss more thoroughly in <xref ref="sec-1-2-smp-mthd"/>.
