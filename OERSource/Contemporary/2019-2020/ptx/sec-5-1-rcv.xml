<title>Introduction to Ranked Voting Theory</title>

<introduction>

<p>In many decision making situations, it is necessary to gather the group consensus. This happens when a group of friends decides which movie to watch, when a company decides which product design to manufacture, and when a democratic country elects its leaders.</p>

<p>While the basic idea of voting is fairly universal, the method by which those votes are used to determine a winner can vary. Amongst a group of friends, you may decide upon a movie by voting for all the movies you’re willing to watch, with the winner being the one with the greatest approval. A company might eliminate unpopular designs then revote on the remaining. A country might look for the candidate with the most votes.</p>

<p>In deciding upon a winner, there is always one main goal: to reflect the preferences of the people in the most fair way possible.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection><title>Preference Schedules</title>

	<p>We use the word <term>ballot</term> to refer to whatever information a voter provides about their preferences. In many elections, a voter's ballot consists of nothing more than their choice of one favorite candidate from the list of all possibilities. This system, however, fails to provide detailed information about voters' preferences. In particular, we will be interested in voters' rankings of all candidates: not only who a voter would choose first, but also their second, third, and subsequent choices.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title>Expressing voter preferences</title>
	<p><ul>
		<li>The options voters are choosing between are called <term>alternatives</term>. In an election for public office, these will be the candidates.</li>
		<li>The complete rankings of the alternatives by each voter are called the <term>preference lists</term>. This information can be presented as a table, called a <term>preference table</term> or a <term>preference schedule</term>.</li>
		<li>The information voters actually provide in an election is called a <term>ballot</term>. This may or may not include all the information included in the voter's preference list.</li>
		<li>A <term>voting method</term> is a set of rules that takes a set of alternatives and ballots and produces an <term>outcome</term> (i.e. a winner).</li>

<example xml:id="vacation">
<p>A vacation club is trying to decide which destination to visit this year: Hawaii (H), Paris (P), or Colorado (C).  Their votes are shown below:</p>

<p>These individual ballots are typically combined into one <term>preference schedule</term> as follows:</p>

		</row>
	</tabular>
</table>

<p>
		This table tells us, for example, that one voter prefers Colorado first, then Paris, and lastly Hawaii. Three voters prefer Colorado first, followed by Hawaii and then Paris.
</p>

<p>Also notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can recover the total number of votes cast: 1+3+3+3=10 total votes.</p>

</example>

<p>
	It is important to emphasize that <alert>the outcome of an election depends on both the voters' preferences and the voting method used</alert>. You should be very suspicious of any news story which claims, <q>Party X won the most seats the parliament of Country Y, indicated that voters strongly support the policies of Party X.</q> This is the case even if the country in question is a democracy with free and fair elections.
</p>
<p>
	For a simple example, consider the election to the Australian parliament in 2016. In that year, election for both houses of Parliament were held at the same time, but using two different voting systems. The results are shown in <xref ref="aus-parli"/>; note that their two houses also happened to be called the Senate and House of Representatives.
</p>

<p>
	The Australian House is elected using instant runoff voting (IRV), which we will discuss in <xref ref="sec-5-3-irv"/>, and produced a small majority for the blue party. The Australian Senate, in contrast, is elected using a form of proportional representation, which led to more parties gaining seats and none with a majority. This happened even though both houses were chosen in the same election, with the same voters casting ballots. This is a dramatic example of how the result of an election depends on the voting system as much as on the choices of the voters, even in a democracy.
	<aside><p>Specifically, the Senate is elected using a method called the single transferrable vote (STV).</p></aside>

<subsection><title>Plurality and Majority</title>

<subsubsection><title>The Plurality Method</title>

<p>The voting method we’re most familiar with in the United States is the  <term>plurality method</term>. We sometimes think of this as <q>majority rule</q>, but it is important to note that these two concepts are different<mdash/>sometimes profoundly so.</p>

<assemblage><title>Plurality versus Majority</title>
<p><ul>
	<li>An alternative is said to have a <term>plurality</term> if it receives the largest number of votes.</li>
	<li>In the <term>plurality method</term>, the alternative with the plurality of first-preference votes is declared the winner.</li>
	<li>An alternative is said to have a <term>majority</term> if they are ranked first by <em>greater than 50%</em> of the voters.</li>
</ul></p>
</assemblage>

<example xml:id="more-vacation">
	<p>
		In <xref ref="vacation"/> above, the first choice votes are 3 for Paris, 3 for Hawaii, and <m>3+1=4</m> for Colorado. Thus, the plurality winner of this election is Colorado.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, Colorado does <em>not</em> have a majority. Colorado was ranked first by 4 out of 10 voters; that is, 40%. The other 60% would prefer to go somewhere other than Colorado.
	</p>

</example>

<p>
	In an election with only two candidates, the plurality candidate will also have a majority. This is not generally the case with more than two candidates. In the US, primary elections often have more than two candidates and thus routinely produce plurality winners who do not have majority support.
</p>

<example xml:id="ma3">
	<p>The results of the 2018 Democratic primary election for Massachusetts's 3rd Congressional district are shown in <xref ref="trahan-is-happy"/>.</p>

	<table xml:id="trahan-is-happy"><caption></caption>

				<cell>Trahan</cell>
				<cell>21.6</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Koh</cell>
				<cell>21.5</cell>

			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>Four other candidates (plus write-ins)</cell>
				<cell>5.8</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	</table>

	<p>
		In this election, Trahan was the plurality winner with 21.6% of the vote. She did not, however, have majority support; 78.4% of voters preferred someone else.
	</p>
</example>

</subsubsection>

<subsubsection><title>Runoff Elections</title>

<p>
	Is it a problem when a plurality candidate does not have a majority? On the one hand, a large majority of voters would have preferred another candidate. On the other hand, if any other candidate were chosen as the winner instead, they would be opposed by an even larger majority!
</p>

<p>
	Thinking in terms of voters' entire preference lists, rather than just their first choices, can help address this problem. Instead of just asking who everyone's <em>favorite</em> candidate is, we can try to identify a candidate who, even if they aren't everyone's first choice, is broadly supported by a larger portion of the population.
</p>

<p>
	One simple way of doing this is to have a second election, called a <term>runoff election</term> between just the top two candidates. For example, in <xref ref="ma3"/>, the runoff would be held between Trahan and Koh. Every voter would choose whichever of those two candidates they prefer (even if they didn't vote for them in the first round). This way, the winning candidate will have a majority. Since there are two rounds of voting, this system is often called a <em>two-round system</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Runoff elections are used for primary elections in a number of US states. Additionally, the top-two primary system used for the Nebraska Legislature is essentially a two-round system. The primary election, in which all candidates compete in one nopartisan election, functions as the first round. The general election, in which the top two candidates run against each other (whether they are of the same or different parties) functions as a runoff election.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, it is worth mentioning that most (though not all) countries with a popularly elected president choose him or her using a two-round system, rather than plurality voting.
</p>

<subsection><title>Voting with Preference Lists</title>

<p>
	A runoff election, however, really only looks at voters' first and second choices. We can do better by looking at voters' entire preference lists, and that is what we will do for the rest of this chapter. We will consider several different voting methods in which voters' entire preference lists are included in their ballot. Unlike runoff elections, there is no actual second election; instead, voters submit their entire preference list all on one ballot, ranking candidates in order of preference. An example of such a ballot is shown in <xref ref="me-ballot"/>.
