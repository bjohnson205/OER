<title>Introduction to Ranked Voting Theory</title>

<introduction>

<p>In many decision making situations, it is necessary to gather the group consensus. This happens when a group of friends decides which movie to watch, when a company decides which product design to manufacture, and when a democratic country elects its leaders.</p>

<p>While the basic idea of voting is fairly universal, the method by which those votes are used to determine a winner can vary. Amongst a group of friends, you may decide upon a movie by voting for all the movies you’re willing to watch, with the winner being the one with the greatest approval. A company might eliminate unpopular designs then revote on the remaining. A country might look for the candidate with the most votes.</p>

<p>In deciding upon a winner, there is always one main goal: to reflect the preferences of the people in the most fair way possible.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection><title>Preference Schedules</title>

	<p>We use the word <term>ballot</term> to refer to whatever information a voter provides about their preferences. In many elections, a voter's ballot consists of nothing more than their choice of one favorite candidate from the list of all possibilities. This system, however, fails to provide detailed information about voters' preferences. In particular, we will be interested in voters' rankings of all candidates: not only who a voter would choose first, but also their second, third, and subsequent choices.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title>Expressing voter preferences</title>
	<p><ul>
		<li>The options voters are choosing between are called <term>alternatives</term>. In an election for public office, these will be the candidates.</li>
		<li>The complete rankings of the alternatives by each voter are called the <term>preference lists</term>. This information can be presented as a table, called a <term>preference table</term> or a <term>preference schedule</term>.</li>
		<li>The information voters actually provide in an election is called a <term>ballot</term>. This may or may not include all the information included in the voter's preference list.</li>
		<li>A <term>voting method</term> is a set of rules that takes a set of alternatives and ballots and produces an <term>outcome</term> (i.e. a winner).</li>
	</ul></p>

<example>
<p>A vacation club is trying to decide which destination to visit this year: Hawaii (H), Paris (P), or Colorado (C).  Their votes are shown below:</p>

	</tabular>
</table>

<p>These individual ballots are typically combined into one <term>preference schedule</term>, which shows the number of voters in the top row that voted for each option:</p>

<table><caption></caption>
	<tabular right="minor">
		<row>
			<cell></cell>
			<cell colspan="4" left="minor" bottom="minor">Votes for each destination</cell>

			<cell></cell>
			<cell>1</cell>
			<cell top="minor">3</cell>
			<cell top="minor">3</cell>

			<cell>H</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
		</row>
	</tabular>
</table>

<p>Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can recover the total number of votes cast: 1+3+3+3=10 total votes.</p>

</example>

<p>
	It is important to emphasize that <alert>the outcome of an election depends on both the voters' preferences and the voting method used</alert>. You should be very suspicious of any news story which claims, <q>Party X won the most seats the parliament of Country Y, indicated that voters strongly support the policies of Party X.</q> This is the case even if the country in question is a democracy with free and fair elections.
</p>
<p>
	For a simple example, consider the election to the Australian parliament in 2016. In that year, election for both houses of Parliament were held at the same time, but using two different voting systems. The results are shown in <xref ref="aus-parli"/>; note that their two houses also happened to be called the Senate and House of Representatives.
</p>

<figure xml:id="aus-parli"><caption>Seats in the Australian Parliament, by party, after the 2016 election</caption>
<sbsgroup widths="50% 50%">
<sidebyside>
<image source="images/aus-house.png" width="100%"/>
<image source="images/aus-senate.png" width="100%"/>
</sidebyside>
<sidebyside>
<p>House of Representatives (150 members)</p>
<p>Senate (75 members)</p>
</sidebyside>
</sbsgroup>
</figure>

<p>
	The Australian House is elected using instant runoff voting (IRV), which we will discuss in <xref ref="sec-5-3-irv"/>, and produced a small majority for the blue party. The Australian Senate, in contrast, is elected using a form of proportional representation, which led to more parties gaining seats and none with a majority. This happened even though both houses were chosen in the same election, with the same voters casting ballots. This is a dramatic example of how the result of an election depends on the voting system as much as on the choices of the voters, even in a democracy.
	<aside><p>Specifically, the Senate is elected using a method called the single transferrable vote (STV).</p></aside>

<subsection><title>The Plurality Method</title>

<p>The voting method we’re most familiar with in the United States is the  <term>plurality method</term>.</p>

<assemblage color="#123456"><title>The plurality method</title>
	<p>A choice is said to have a <term>plurality</term> if it receives the largest number of votes.
		In the plurality method, the choice with the plurality of first-preference votes is declared the winner.
		<!--Ties are possible, and would have to be settled through some sort of run-off vote.-->
	</p>
	<p>Warn that plurality isn't majority!</p>
