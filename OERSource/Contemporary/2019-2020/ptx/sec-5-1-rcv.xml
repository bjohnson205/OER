<title>Introduction to Ranked Voting Theory</title>

<introduction>

<p>In many decision making situations, it is necessary to gather the group consensus. This happens when a group of friends decides which movie to watch, when a company decides which product design to manufacture, and when a democratic country elects its leaders.</p>

<p>While the basic idea of voting is fairly universal, the method by which those votes are used to determine a winner can vary. Amongst a group of friends, you may decide upon a movie by voting for all the movies you’re willing to watch, with the winner being the one with the greatest approval. A company might eliminate unpopular designs then revote on the remaining. A country might look for the candidate with the most votes.</p>

<p>In deciding upon a winner, there is always one main goal: to reflect the preferences of the people in the most fair way possible.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection><title>Preference Schedules</title>

<p>To begin, we’re going to want more information than a traditional ballot normally provides. A traditional ballot usually asks you to pick your favorite from a list of choices. This ballot fails to provide any information on how a voter would rank the alternatives if their first choice was unsuccessful.</p>

<assemblage>
	<title>Preference ballot</title>
	<p>A <term>preference ballot</term> is a ballot in which the voter ranks the choices in order of preference.</p>
</assemblage>

<example>
<p>A vacation club is trying to decide which destination to visit this year: Hawaii (H), Paris (P), or Colorado (C).  Their votes are shown below:</p>

			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
		</row>
	</tabular>
</table>

<p>These individual ballots are typically combined into one <term>preference schedule</term>, which shows the number of voters in the top row that voted for each option:</p>

<table><caption></caption>
	<tabular right="minor">
		<row>
			<cell></cell>
			<cell colspan="4" left="minor" bottom="minor">Votes for each destination</cell>
		</row>
		<row bottom="major">
			<cell></cell>
			<cell>1</cell>
			<cell top="minor">3</cell>
			<cell top="minor">3</cell>
			<cell top="minor">3</cell>
		</row>
		<row left="minor" bottom="minor">
			<cell>1st choice</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>H</cell>

		</row>
		<row left="minor" bottom="minor">
			<cell>2nd choice</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>H</cell>
			<cell>H</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
		</row>
		<row left="minor" bottom="minor">

			<cell>H</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
			<cell>C</cell>
			<cell>P</cell>
		</row>
	</tabular>
</table>

<p>Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can recover the total number of votes cast: 1+3+3+3=10 total votes.</p>

<subsection><title>The Plurality Method</title>

<p>The voting method we’re most familiar with in the United States is the  <term>plurality method</term>.</p>

<assemblage color="#123456"><title>The plurality method</title>
	<p>A choice is said to have a <term>plurality</term> if it receives the largest number of votes.
		In the plurality method, the choice with the plurality of first-preference votes is declared the winner.
		<!--Ties are possible, and would have to be settled through some sort of run-off vote.-->
	</p>
	<p>Warn that plurality isn't majority!</p>
