  <title>Mean and Median</title>

<p>It is often desirable to use a few numbers to summarize a distribution. One important aspect
of a distribution is where its center is located. Measures of central tendency are discussed
first. A second aspect of a distribution is how spread out it is. In other words, how much the
data in the distribution vary from one another. The second section describes measures of
variability.</p>

<p>Let's begin by trying to find the most "typical" value of a data set.
Note that we just used the word "typical" although in many cases you might think of using
the word "average." We need to be careful with the word "average" as it means different
things to different people in different contexts. One of the most common uses of the word
"average" is what mathematicians and statisticians call the <term>arithmetic mean</term>, or just plain old
<term>mean</term> for short. "Arithmetic mean" sounds rather fancy, but you have likely calculated a
mean many times without realizing it; the mean is what most people think of when they use
the word "average".</p>

  <title>Mean</title>
    <p>
      The <term>mean</term> of a set of data is the sum of the data values divided by the number of values.
    </p>

<example>
  <p>Marci’s exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. The mean of these values
would be:</p>

<me> \frac{79+86+82+94}{4}=85.25 </me>

<p>Typically, we round means to one more decimal place than the orgiinal data had. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3.</p>

</example>

<example>
  <p>The number of touchdown (TD) passes thrown by each of the 31 teams in the National Football League in the 2000 season are shown below:</p>

  <p>37 33 33 32 29 28 28 23 22 22 22 21 21 21 20</p>

  <p> 20 19 19 18 18 18 18 16 15 14 14 14 12 12 9 6</p>

  <p>Adding these values, we get 634 total TDs. Dividing by 31, the number of data values, we
get 634/31 = 20.4516. It would be appropriate to round this to 20.5.</p>

<p>It would be most correct for us to report that “The mean number of touchdown passes thrown
in the NFL in the 2000 season was 20.5 passes,” but it is not uncommon to see the more
casual word “average” used in place of “mean.”</p>

  <p>The price of a jar of peanut butter at 5 stores was: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the mean price</p>.
