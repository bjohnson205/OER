	<li>This year, Cunningham Lake in Omaha has been fighting an infestation of zebra mussels, an invasive species. Suppose that the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission wants to estimate their population. They capture and mark 194 zebra mussels, then release them back into the lake. After waiting a month, they capture 84 mussels, of  which 13 had previously been marked. Using this data, estimate the number of zebra mussels in Cunningham Lake.

	<li><p>The UNL Office of Global Strategies is looking to find out how many students study abroad. They know that there are 26,000 students in total at UNL. They survey 700 randomly selected students, of whom 95 have studied abroad while at UNL. The surveys take place in person on campus.
		<ol>
			<li>To use this data to approximate the total number of UNL students who have studied abroad, which enumeration method would we use: one sample estimation or mark-recapture? </li>
			<li>Use the method you chose in part (a) to compute an approximation of the number of students who have studied abroad.</li>
			<li>Identify possible sources of sampling bias.</li>
