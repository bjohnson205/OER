	<aside><p>This map is based on the one found <url href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electoral_systems_map.svg">here</url>. It has been modified by combining similar systems into common categories and making the colors easier to distinguish.</p></aside>

		The map in <xref ref="electoral-systems-map"/> shows the systems used to elect the lower house of each country's legislature. You can see a larger version if you right-click and select <q>view image</q>. Note that the Borda count is included in the <q>other systems</q> category (green), but is used in only one of those countries: the Pacific island nation of Nauru. It is also used, however, to elect two seats in the parliament of Slovenia that are reserved for the Hungarian and Italian ethnic minorities.
