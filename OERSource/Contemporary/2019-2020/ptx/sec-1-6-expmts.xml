<title>1.6 Experiments</title>

<p>So far, we have primarily discussed <term>observational studies</term> – studies in which conclusions would be drawn from observations of a sample or the population.  In some cases these observations might be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a “no turn on red” sign.  In other cases the observations are solicited, like in a survey or a poll.</p>

<p>In contrast, it is common to use <term>experiments</term> when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence.  In an experiment, some kind of <term>treatment</term> is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded.</p>
