	<title>Exponential Growth</title>

<subsection><title>Exponential Growth</title>

<p>Suppose that every year, only 10% of the fish in a lake have surviving offspring.  If there were 100 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 110 fish.  If there were 1000 fish in the lake last year, there would now be 1100 fish.  Absent any inhibiting factors, populations of people and animals tend to grow by a percent of the existing population each year.</p>

<p>Suppose our lake began with 1000 fish, and 10% of the fish have surviving offspring each year.  Since we start with 1000 fish, <m>P_0 = 1000.</m> How do we calculate <m>P_1</m>?  The new population will be the old population, plus an additional 10%. Symbolically:</p>

<me>P_1 = P_0 + 0.10P_0</me>

<p>Notice this could be condensed to a shorter form by factoring:</p>

<me>P_1 = P_0 + 0.10P_0 = 1P_0 + 0.10P_0 = (1+0.10)P_0 = 1.10P_0</me>

<p>While 10% is the <term>growth rate</term>, 1.10 is the <term>growth multiplier</term>. Notice that 1.10 can be thought of as “the original 100% plus an additional 10%”.</p>

<p>For our fish population,</p>

<me>P_1 = 1.10(1000) = 1100</me>

<p>We could then calculate the population in later years:</p>
<me>P_2 = 1.10P_1 = 1.10(1100) = 1210</me>
<me>P_3 = 1.10P_2 = 1.10(1210) = 1331</me>

<p>Notice that in the first year, the population grew by 100 fish, in the second year, the population grew by 110 fish, and in the third year the population grew by 121 fish. While there is a constant <emph>percentage growth</emph>, the actual increase in number of fish is increasing each year.</p>
