<subsection><title>The Method of Pairwise Comparisons</title>

	<assemblage><title>The Method of Pairwise Comparisons</title>
		<p>
			The <term>Method of Pairwise Comparisons</term> is like a round robin tournament: we compare how candidates perform one-on-one, as we’ve done above. It has the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>List all possible pairs of candidates.</li>
				<li><p>For each pair, determine who would win if the election were only between those two candidates.
					<ol>
						<li>To do so, we must look at all the voters. Each voter casts their ballot for whichever candidate they ranked higher <em>of the pair being considered</em> (even if they didn’t rank that candidate first).</li>
						<li>The winner of each pair is given 1 point, and the loser, 0 points. If it is a tie, they both get <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> point. </li>
						</ol>
					</p></li>
				<li>After finding each pairwise winner, add up the points for each candidate. The candidate with the most points is the winner.</li>
			</ol>
			Note that this method results in ties a little more often than some of the other methods.

<example><title>The 2009 mayoral election in Burlington, VT</title>

	<p>
		In 2009, the city of Burlington, Vermont used IRV to elect their mayor. The results of this election are shown below, in a simplified form to include only the three main candidates.

<subsection><title>The Condorcet Criterion</title>

	<p>
		The <term>Condorcet criterion</term> is named for Nicolas, Marquis de Condorcet.
		<fn>He was a pretty cool guy.</fn>
		And the paragraph continues.
	</p>

	<assemblage><title>The Condorcet Criterion</title>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>A candidate who would defeat any other candidate in a one-on-one contest is called a <term>Condorcet winner</term> (also called a <term>Condorcet candidate</term>), pronounced <q>condor-say</q>.</li>
				<li>The <term>Condorcet criterion</term> states that, if a Condorcet winner exists, then that candidate should be the winner of the election.</li>
				<li>Note that not every election may have a Condorcet winner! If there is no Condorcet winner, then the Condorcet criterion does not apply; that is, it does not state that any candidate ought to win.</li>
			</ul>
