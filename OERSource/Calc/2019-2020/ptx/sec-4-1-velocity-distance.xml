  <introduction permid="pNu">
    <p permid="IAS">
      In the first section of the text,
      we considered a moving object with known position at time <m>t</m>, namely,
      a tennis ball tossed into the air with height <m>s</m>
      (in feet)
      at time <m>t</m>
      (in seconds)
      given by <m>s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2</m>.
      We investigated the average velocity of the ball on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      computed by the difference quotient <m>\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}</m>.
      We found that we could determine the instantaneous velocity of the ball at time <m>t</m> by taking the derivative of the position function,
      <me permid="BGn">
        s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="oIb">
      Thus, if its position function is differentiable,
      we can find the velocity of a moving object at any point in time.
    </p>

    <p permid="UPk">
      From this study of position and velocity we have learned a great deal.
      We can use the derivative to find a function's instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain,
      to find where the function is increasing or decreasing,
      where it is concave up or concave down,
      and to locate relative extremes.
      The vast majority of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the situation where a particular function is known and we seek information that relies on knowing the function's instantaneous rate of change.
      For all these tasks,
      we proceed from a function <m>f</m> to its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>,
      and use the meaning of the derivative to help us answer important questions.
    </p>

    <p permid="AWt">
      We have also encountered the reverse situation,
      where we know the derivative of a function,
      <m>f'</m>, and try to deduce information about <m>f</m>.
      We will focus our attention in <xref ref="C-4">Chapter</xref> on this problem:
      if we know the instantaneous rate of change of a function,
      can we find the function itself?
      We start with a more specific question:
      if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object moving along a straight line path,
      can we find its corresponding position function?

    <title>Area under the graph of the velocity function</title>

    <p permid="hdC">
      In <xref ref="PA-4-1">Example</xref>,
      we learned that
      when the velocity of a moving object's velocity is constant
      (and positive),
      the area under the velocity curve over an interval of time tells us the distance the object traveled.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-4-1-VelArea" permid="ybN">
      <caption>At left, a constant velocity function; at right, a non-constant velocity function.</caption>
      <image width="74%" source="images/4_1_VelArea" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="NkL">
      The left-hand graph of <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea">Figure</xref>
      shows the velocity of an object moving at 2 miles per hour over the time interval <m>[1,1.5]</m>.
      The area <m>A_1</m> of the shaded region under <m>y = v(t)</m> on <m>[1,1.5]</m> is
      <me permid="hNw">
        A_1= 2 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1 \, \text{mile}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="trU">
      This result is simply the fact that distance equals rate times time,
      provided the rate is constant.
      Thus, if <m>v(t)</m> is constant on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      the distance traveled on <m>[a,b]</m> is equal to the area <m>A</m> given by
      <me permid="NUF">
        A = v(a) (b-a) = v(a) \Delta t
      </me>,
      where <m>\Delta t</m> is the change in <m>t</m> over the interval.
      (Since the velocity is constant,
      we can use any value of <m>v(t)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
      we simply chose <m>v(a)</m>,
      the value at the interval's left endpoint.)
      For several examples where the velocity function is piecewise constant, see
      <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/9T">http://gvsu.edu/s/9T</url>.<fn>
      Marc Renault, calculus applets.
      </fn></p>

    <p permid="Zzd">
      The situation is more complicated when the velocity function is not constant.
      But on relatively small intervals where <m>v(t)</m> does not vary much,
      we can use 
      the area principle to estimate the distance traveled.
      The graph at right in <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea">Figure</xref>
      shows a non-constant velocity function.
      On the interval <m>[1,1.5]</m>, the
      velocity varies from <m>v(1) = 2.5</m> down to <m>v(1.5) \approx 2.1</m>.
      One estimate for the distance traveled is the area of the pictured rectangle,
      <me permid="ubO">
        A_2 = v(1) \Delta t = 2.5 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1.25 \, \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="FGm">
      Note that because <m>v</m> is decreasing on <m>[1,1.5]</m>,
      <m>A_2 = 1.25</m> is an over-estimate of the actual distance traveled.
    </p>
    <!--<sidebyside widths="47% 47%" margins="0%" valign="bottom">-->
    <p permid="lNv">
      To estimate the area under this non-constant velocity function on a wider interval,
      say <m>[0,3]</m>, one rectangle will not give a good approximation.
      Instead, we could use the six rectangles pictured in <xref ref="F-4-1-VelArea2">Figure</xref>,
      find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total.
      Obviously there are choices to make and issues to understand:
      How many rectangles should we use?
      Where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle's height?
      What happens if the velocity is sometimes negative?
      Can we find the exact area under any non-constant curve?

<!--</sidebyside>-->
    <p permid="RUE">
      We will study these questions and more in what follows;
      for now it suffices to observe that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool for estimating distance traveled from a velocity function,
      as well as for estimating the area under an arbitrary curve.
      To explore the use of multiple rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function,

            By thinking about how the power rule for differentiation works,
            we can undo this rule and find a position function <m>s</m> whose derivative is <m>v</m>.
            For instance, since <m>\frac{d}{dt}[t^4] = 4t^3</m>,
            we see that <m>\frac{d}{dt}[\frac{1}{8}t^4] = \frac{1}{2}t^3</m>.

            then it is straightforward to check that <m>s'(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^3 - \frac{3}{2}t^2 + \frac{3}{2}t + \frac{3}{2}</m>,

            This is the change in the walker's position over the time interval <m>[0,2]</m>,

    <p permid="Kqf">
      When the velocity of a moving object is positive,
      the object's position is always increasing.
      (We will soon consider situations where velocity is negative;
      for now, we focus on the situation where velocity is always positive.) We have established that whenever <m>v</m> is constant on an interval,
      the exact distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve.
      When <m>v</m> is not constant,
      we can estimate the total distance traveled by finding the areas of rectangles that approximate the area under the velocity curve.
    </p>

    <p permid="qxo">
      Thus, we see that finding the area between a curve and the horizontal axis is an important exercise:
      besides being an interesting geometric question,
      if the curve gives the velocity of a moving object,
      the area under the curve tells us the exact distance traveled on an interval.
      We can estimate this area if we have a graph or a table of values for the velocity function.
    </p>

    <p permid="WEx">
      In <xref ref="act-4-1-1">Example</xref>,
      we encountered an alternate approach to finding the distance traveled.
      If <m>y = v(t)</m> is a formula for the instantaneous velocity
      of a moving object,
      then <m>v</m> must be the derivative of the object's position function,
      <m>s</m>.
      If we can find a formula for <m>s(t)</m> from the formula for <m>v(t)</m>,
      we will know the position of the object at time <m>t</m>,
      and the change in position over a particular time interval tells us the distance traveled on that interval.

      For a simple example,

      The respective locations of the person at times
      <m>t = 0.25</m> and <m>t = 1.5</m> are
      <m>s(1.5) = 4.5</m> and <m>s(0.25) = 0.75</m>, and therefore

      Since the velocity for <m>1.5 \lt  t \lt  2</m> is <m>v = -4</m>,
      indicating motion in the westward direction,
      the woman first walked 4.5 miles east,
      then 2 miles west, followed by 3 more miles east.
      Thus, the total change in her position is
      <me permid="KZZ">
        \text{change in position}  = 4.5 - 2 + 3 = 5.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="EAT">
      We have been able to answer these questions fairly easily,
      and if we think about the problem graphically,
      we can generalize our solution to the more complicated setting when velocity is not constant,
      and possibly negative.
    </p>

      <caption>At left, the velocity function of the person walking; at right, the corresponding position function.</caption>

    <p permid="kIc">
      In <xref ref="F-4-1-NegVel">Figure</xref>,
      we see how the distances we computed can be viewed as areas:
      <m>A_1 = 4.5</m> comes from multiplyimg rate times time (<m>3 \cdot 1.5</m>),
      as do <m>A_2</m> and <m>A_3</m>.
      But while <m>A_2</m> is an area
      (and is therefore positive),
      because the velocity function is negative for <m>1.5 \lt t \lt 2</m>,
      this area has a negative sign associated with it.
      The negative area distinguishes between distance traveled and change in position.
    </p>

    <p permid="QPl">
      The distance traveled is the sum of the areas,
      <me permid="rhi">
        D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wWu">
      But the change in position has to account for travel in the negative direction.  
      An area above the <m>t</m>-axis is considered positive because it represents distance traveled in the positive direction,
      while one below the <m>t</m>-axis is viewed as negative because it represents travel in thenegative direction.
      Thus, the change in the woman's position is
      <me permid="Xor">
        s(3) - s(0) = (+4.5) + (-2) + (+3) = 5.5 \ \text{miles}
      </me>.
      In other words,
      the woman walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction,
      followed by two miles in the negative direction,
      and then 3 more miles in the positive direction.
    </p>

    <p permid="ddD">
      Negative velocity is also seen in the graph of the position function <m>y=s(t)</m>.
      Its slope is negative (specifically,
      <m>-4</m>) on the interval
      <m>1.5\lt t\lt 2</m> because the velocity is <m>-4</m> on that interval.
      The negative slope shows the position function is decreasing because the woman is walking east,
      rather than west.
    </p>

    <p permid="JkM">
      To summarize, we see that if velocity is sometimes negative,
      a moving object's change in position different from its distance traveled.
      If we compute separately the distance traveled on each interval where velocity is positive or negative,
      we can calculate either the total distance traveled or the total change in position.
      We assign a negative value to distances traveled in the negative direction when we calculate change in position,
      but a positive value when we calculate the total distance traveled.
