  <introduction><p>
  Up to this point, we have been representing a graph by a single equation involving two variables such as <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. However, some items are not really well described by such equations.

In this section, you will study situations in which it is useful to introduce a <em>third} variable</em> to represent a curve in the plane.</p>
  </introduction>
  
  
  <subsection><title>Parametric Equations</title>
  <p>
  Consider the path of an object that is propelled into the air at an angle of <m>45^{\circ}</m>.  In a physics class you might learn that this object would follow a parabolic path.  That is 

<me>y=-\frac{x^2}{72}+x</me>
However, this equation does not tell the whole story. Although it does tell you where the object has been, it does not tell you <em>when</em> the object was at a given point <m>(x, y)</m> on the path.

To determine this time, you can introduce a third variable <m>t</m>, called a parameter. It is possible to write both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as functions of <m>t</m> to obtain the parametric equations

<md>
<mrow>x(t) \amp= 24 \sqrt{2}t</mrow>
<mrow>y(t) \amp =-16t^2+24\sqrt{2}t</mrow>
</md>
The parametric equations are graphed in <xref ref="basicparametricgraph">Figure</xref> below.  Using the parametric equations we can state properties such as: at time <m>t = 0</m>, the object is at the point <m>(0, 0)</m> and at time <m>t = 1</m>, the object is at the point <m>(24 \sqrt{2},24\sqrt{2}-16)</m>.
 
</p>
  
      <figure xml:id="basicparametricgraph">
      <caption>A plot of the parametric equations <m>x(t)= 24 \sqrt{2}t</m>, <m>y(t) =-16t^2+24\sqrt{2}t</m>.  Notice that when <m>t=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}</m>, <m>x=36</m> and <m>y=18</m> (you can get these values by plugging <m>t=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{4}</m> into the equations for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>). </caption>

  <example>
  <statement><p>
  Suppose the position of an object is given by the parametric equations
  <md>
<mrow>x(t) \amp= 24 \sqrt{2}t</mrow>
<mrow>y(t) \amp =-16t^2+24\sqrt{2}t.</mrow>
</md>
After <m>t=3</m> seconds, what is the position of the object If the origin represents the initial position?</p>
  </statement>
  <hint>
  <p>
  Try plugging <m>t=3</m> into each equation.
  </p>
  </hint>
  <solution>
  <p>
  By plugging <m>t=3</m> into each of the equations for <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> we see that 
    <md>
<mrow>x(3) \amp= 24 \sqrt{2}3</mrow>
<mrow>y(3) \amp =-16(3)^2+24\sqrt{2}(3)</mrow>
</md>
Therefore, after <m>3</m> seconds the object is located at <m>(24 \sqrt{2}3,144-72 \sqrt{2}).</m>

  </solution>
