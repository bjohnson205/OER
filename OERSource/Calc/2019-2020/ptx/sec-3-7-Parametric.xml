  <introduction><p>
  Up to this point, we have been representing a graph by a single equation involving two variables such as <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. However, some items are not really well described by such equations.

In this section, you will study situations in which it is useful to introduce a <em>third} variable</em> to represent a curve in the plane.</p>

  <p>
  Consider the path of an object that is propelled into the air at an angle of <m>45^{\circ}</m>.  In a physics class you might learn that this object would follow a parabolic path.  That is 

<me>y=-\frac{x^2}{72}+x</me>
