      In many different settings,
      we are interested in knowing where a function achieves its least and greatest values.
      These can be important in applications <mdash /> say to identify a point at which maximum profit or minimum cost occurs <mdash /> or in theory to characterize the behavior of a function or a family of related functions.

    <p permid="BkB">
      Consider the simple and familiar example of a parabolic function such as <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 48</m>
      (shown at left in <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>)
      that represents the height of an object tossed vertically:
      its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola and represents the greatest height the object reaches.
      This maximum value is an especially important point on the graph,
      the point at which the curve changes from increasing to decreasing.

      If a continuous function has a relative maximum at <m>c</m>,
      then it is both necessary and sufficient that the function change from being increasing just before <m>c</m> to decreasing just after <m>c</m>.
      A continuous function has a relative minimum at <m>c</m> if and only if the function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>c</m>.
      (See <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>.)
      There are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur:
      either <m>f'(c) = 0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined.

      the function pictured there has a horizontal tangent line at the noted point,

          Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,
          it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
          we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
          From the equation
          <me permid="Afi">
            e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
          </me>
          and the zero product property,
          it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>.

          Next, to apply the first derivative test,
          we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers.
          Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
          it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
          for instance,
          the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
          We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,
          along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.

        <p permid="ixd">
          To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>
          we identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
          For instance, for <m>x \lt -1</m>,
          we could determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
          <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m> at the value <m>x = -2</m>.
          We note that both <m>e^{-2x}</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m> are positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>,
          while <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
          Hence, each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
          which we indicate by writing <q><m>+++</m>.</q>
          Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
          which we denote by the <q><m>+</m></q>
          in the interval to the left of <m>x = -1</m>.
          And, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
          we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
          so we write <q>INC</q>
          to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
          In a similar way,
          we find that <m>f'</m> is positive and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
          and <m>f'</m> is negative and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="OEm">
          Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
          In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
          from positive to negative,
          so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
          since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
          <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.

    <title>The second derivative test</title>
    <p permid="KEn">
      Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself.
      For instance, if <m>f''</m> is positive on an interval,
      then we know that <m>f'</m> is increasing on that interval and,
      consequently, that <m>f</m> is concave up,
      so throughout that interval the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> lies below the curve at every point.
      At a point where <m>f'(p) = 0</m>, 
      the sign of the second derivative determines whether <m>f</m> has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number <m>p</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="qLw">
      In <xref ref="F-3-1-2Dtest">Figure</xref>,
      we see the four possibilities for a function <m>f</m> that has a critical number <m>p</m> at which <m>f'(p) = 0</m>,
      provided <m>f''(p)</m> is not zero on an interval including <m>p</m>
      (except possibly at <m>p</m>).
      On either side of the critical number,
      <m>f''</m> can be either positive or negative,
      and hence <m>f</m> can be either concave up or concave down.
      In the first two graphs,
      <m>f</m> does not change concavity at <m>p</m>, and in those situations,
      <m>f</m> has either a local minimum or local maximum.
      In particular, if <m>f'(p) = 0</m> and <m>f''(p) \lt 0</m>,
      then <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>p</m> with a horizontal tangent line,
      so <m>f</m> has a local maximum there.
      This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when <m>f''(p)</m> is positive,
      is the substance of the <em>second derivative test</em>.

          By the first derivative test,

          Next, we move on to investigate concavity.

          Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which <m>f''</m> is positive and negative,

          Building a sign chart for <m>f''</m> in the exact same way we do for <m>f'</m>,

          similarly, the point <m>E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})</m> is a local minimum.
          Note, too, that <m>f</m> is concave down at <m>A</m> and concave up at <m>B</m>,
          which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test.
          At points <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>, concavity changes,

          Finally, at point <m>C</m>,
          <m>f</m> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line,
