  <introduction permid="job">
    <p permid="JFY">
      Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative,
      and the definition of the derivative involves a limit,
      there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits.
      In addition,
      the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>.
      If <m>f</m> is a differentiable function,
      thenin the definition
      <me permid="CLt">
        f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
      </me>,
      not only does <m>h \to 0</m> in the denominator,
      but also <m>(f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0</m> in the numerator,
      since <m>f</m> is continuous.
      Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do:
      indeed, limits of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> can take on any value,
      as is evidenced by evaluating <m>f'(x)</m> for varying values of <m>x</m> for a function such as <m>f'(x) = x^2</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pNh">
      We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that result from the derivative definition,
      including a large number of shortcut rules.
      In this section, we turn the situation upside-down:
      instead of using limits to evaluate derivatives,
      we explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits.

    <p permid="VUq">
      The idea demonstrated in <xref ref="PA-2-8">Example</xref>
      <mdash /> that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form
      <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest <mdash /> can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits.
      We with a function <m>h(x)</m> that can be written as a quotient
      <m>h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m>,
      where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable at <m>x=a</m> and for which <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>.
      We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} h(x)</m>.
      <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR">Figure</xref> illustrates the situation.
      We see that both <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> have an <m>x</m>-intercept at <m>x = a</m>.
      Their respective tangent line approximations <m>L_f</m> and <m>L_g</m> at <m>x = a</m>
      are also shown in the figure.
      We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <m>x \to a</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Cbz">
      First, let's recall that <m>L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)</m> and <m>L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is getting arbitrarily close to <m>a</m> when we take the limit,
      we can replace <m>f</m> with <m>L_f</m> and replace <m>g</m> with <m>L_g</m>,
      and thus we observe that
      <md permid="iSC">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iiI">
      Next, we remember that both <m>f(a) = 0</m> and <m>g(a) = 0</m>,
      which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate.
      Substituting these values for <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> in the limit above,
      we now have
      <md permid="vgU">
        <mrow>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}</mrow>
        <mrow>=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</mrow>
      </md>,
      where the latter equality holds because
      <m>\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1</m> when <m>x</m> is approaching
      (but not equal to) <m>a</m>.
      Finally, we note that <m>\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m> is constant with respect to <m>x</m>, and thus
      <me permid="OZL">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OpR">
      This result holds as long as <m>g'(a)</m> is not equal to zero.
      The formal name of the result is L'Hôpital's Rule.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="KLr">
      <title>L'Hôpital's Rule</title>
      <idx><h>L'Hôpital's rule</h></idx>

      <p permid="uxa">
        Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be differentiable at <m>x=a</m>,
        and suppose that <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m> and that <m>g'(a) \neq 0</m>.
        Then <m>\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="aEj">
      In practice,
      we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hôpital's Rule,
      which states that (under the identical assumptions as the boxed rule above and the extra assumption that <m>g'</m> is continuous at <m>x=a</m>)
      <me permid="bod">
        \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}
      </me>,
      provided the righthand limit exists.
      This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hôpital's Rule:
      if <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> produces an indeterminate limit of form <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>,
      that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives,
      <m>\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="GLs">
      For example,
      if we consider the limit from <xref ref="PA-2-8">Example</xref>,
      <me permid="Hvm">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}
      </me>,
      by L'Hôpital's Rule we have that
      <me permid="nCv">
        \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
      </me>
    </p>

    <p permid="mSB">
      By replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives,
      we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.

      the main idea is that the slopes of the tangent lines to <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m> determine the value of the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m>.
      We see this in <xref ref="F-2-8-LHR2">Figure</xref>,

    <p permid="foc">
      It's not the fact that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> both approach zero that matters most,

      This is a good way to remember what L'Hôpital's Rule says:
      if <m>f(a) = g(a) = 0</m>,
      the the limit of <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> as <m>x \to a</m> is given by the ratio of the slopes of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> at <m>x = a</m>.

    <title>Limits involving <m>\infty</m></title>
    <p permid="XJD">
      The concept of infinity,
          <idx><h>infinity</h></idx>
      denoted <m>\infty</m>, arises naturally in calculus,
      as it does in much of mathematics.
      It is important to note from the outset that <m>\infty</m> is a concept,
      but not a number itself.
      Indeed, the notion of <m>\infty</m> naturally invokes the idea of limits.
      Consider, for example, the function <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>,
      whose graph is pictured in <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>.
    </p>

    <p permid="DQM">
      We note that <m>x = 0</m> is not in the domain of <m>f</m>,
      so we may naturally wonder what happens as <m>x \to 0</m>.
      As <m>x \to 0^+</m>, we observe that <m>f(x)</m>
      <em>increases without bound</em>.
      That is, we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> closer and closer
      (but not equal)
      to 0, while keeping <m>x \gt 0</m>.
      This is a good way to think about what infinity represents:
      a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-2-8-Infty" permid="KpS">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>.</caption>

    </figure>

    <p permid="jXV">
      Recall that the statement <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>,
      means that can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>.
      We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either <m>L</m> or <m>a</m> can be <m>\infty</m>.
      For instance, for <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we now write
      <me permid="zQN">
        \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty
      </me>,
      by which we mean that we can make
      <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to 0.
      In a similar way, we write
      <me permid="fXW">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0
      </me>,
      since we can make <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> as close to 0 as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large (i.e., by letting <m>x</m> increase without bound).
    </p>

    <p permid="Qfe">
      In general, the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty</m> means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as large as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently close
      (but not equal)
      to <m>a</m>, and the notation
      <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L</m>  means that we can make <m>f(x)</m> as close to <m>L</m> as we like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.
      This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits,
      and to limits involving <m>-\infty</m>.
      For example, returning to <xref ref="F-2-8-Infty">Figure</xref>
      and <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{x}</m>, we can say that
      <me permid="Mff">
        \lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0

    <p permid="wmn">

      <me permid="smo">

      </me>
      if we can make the value of <m>f(x)</m> as large as we'd like by taking <m>x</m> sufficiently large.

      these limits are reversed,

      To evaluate <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}</m>,
      we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule,

      Doing so, it follows that

            Because this limit has indeterminate form

            The latest limit is indeterminate for the same reason,

            Note how each application of the rule produces a simpler numerator and denominator.

      To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions
      <m>\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> that results in an indeterminate form of <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>,
      in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound.
      We say that the function <m>g</m> <em>dominates</em>
      the function <m>f</m> as <m>x \to \infty</m> provided that
      <me permid="BGa">
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0

      Finally, if the value of <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> is finite and nonzero,
      we say that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
      <em>grow at the same rate</em>.
      For example,
      we saw that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0</m>,
      so <m>e^x</m> dominates <m>x^2</m>,
      while <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} = \frac{3}{7}</m>,

      <m>g(x) = 7x^2 + 9x - 10</m> grow at the same rate.
