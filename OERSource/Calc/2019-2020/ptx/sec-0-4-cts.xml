<introduction>
<p>In this section we introduce the idea of a continuous function.  
Many of the results in calculus require that the functions be continuous so having a strong understanding of continuous functions will be very important.

    <p permid="AeI">
      Intuitively,
      a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page.
      Alternatively,
      we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it.
    </p>

    </figure>
    
    
        <p permid="glR">
      First consider the function in the left-most graph.
      Note that <m>f(1)</m> is not defined,
      which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of <m>f</m> at <m>a = 1</m>.
      If you were to draw the graph of <m>f</m> yourself then you would need to lift your pencil when you reached <m>f(1)</m>.
      We will naturally say that <m>f</m> is
      <em>not continuous at <m>a = 1</m></em>.
      For the function <m>g</m>,
      we observe that while <m>g(1)</m> is defined,
      the value of <m>g(1) = 2</m> is not what you would "expect."  Specifically, you would expect <m>g(1)</m> to be 3, not 2.
      Thus, to draw the graph of <m>g</m> you would need to lift you pencil at <m>a=1</m>.
      Again, we will say that <m>g</m> is
      <em>not continuous</em> at <m>a=1</m>,
      even though the function is defined at <m>a = 1</m>.
      Finally, the function <m>h</m> appears to be the most "well-behaved" of all three,
      since at <m>a = 1</m> its limit and its function value agree.  In this case we would say that <m>h</m> is continuous at <m>a=1</m>.
    </p>

<p>The above examples demonstrate a discontinuity commonly know as a <em>removable discontinuity</em>. 
 This is, however, not the only way in which a function can be discontinuous.  Another type of discontinuity is the so called <em>jump</em> discontinuity.

      <caption>Places where functions make a "jump" also produce discontinuities.</caption>
