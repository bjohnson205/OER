        Your monthly utility payments,

        the amount you spend on groceries each week;
        all are examples of sequences.

      Sequences of integers are of such interest to mathematicians and others that they have a journal<fn>

      Our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous continuous functions.
      Sequences model <em>discrete</em>
      instead of continuous information.
      We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate
      <em>sequences</em> and <em>series</em>,
      and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.

    Suppose you receive <m>\dollar5000</m> through an inheritance.
    You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays <m>8\%</m> annually,
    compounded monthly.
    That means that each month your investment earns <m>\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P</m> additional dollars,
    where <m>P</m> is your principal balance at the start of the month.
    So in the first month your investment earns

    If you reinvest this money,
    you will then have <m>\dollar5033.33</m> in your account at the end of the first month.
    From this point on,
    assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.

    <p permid="AQp">
      As <xref ref="PA-8-1">Example</xref> illustrates,
      many discrete phenomena can be represented as lists of numbers
      (like the amount of money in an account over a period of months).
      We call any such list a <em>sequence</em>.
      A sequence is nothing more than list of terms in some order.
      We often list the entries of the sequence with subscripts,
      <me permid="ROA">
        s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n \ldots
      </me>,
      where the subscript denotes the position of the entry in the sequence.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="D-8-1-sequence" permid="dsY">
      <statement>
        <p permid="PZn">
          A sequence is a list of terms
          <m>s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots</m> in a specified order.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p permid="gXy">
      We can think of a sequence as a function <m>f</m> whose domain is the set of positive integers where 
      <m>f(n) = s_n</m> for each positive integer <m>n</m>.
      This alternative view will be be useful in many situations.
    </p>

    <p permid="NeH">
      We often denote the sequence
      <me permid="xVJ">
        s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots
      </me>
      by <m>\{s_n\}</m>.
      The value <m>s_n</m> (alternatively <m>s(n)</m>) is called the <m>n</m>th <em>term</em>
          <idx><h>sequence</h><h>term</h></idx>
      in the sequence.
      If the terms are all 0 after some fixed value of <m>n</m>,
      we say the sequence is finite.
      Otherwise the sequence is infinite.
      With infinite sequences,
      we are often interested in their end behavior and the idea of
      <em>convergent</em> sequences.
