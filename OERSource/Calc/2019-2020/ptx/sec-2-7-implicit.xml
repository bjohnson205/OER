  <introduction permid="VFV">
    <p permid="FrE">
      In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
      we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of <m>x</m>.
      But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are impossible to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

      <image width="100%" source="images/2_7_Intro" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="lyN">
      Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
      Because of the circle's symmetry,
      for each <m>x</m> value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
      there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
      For instance, in <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>,
      we have labeled <m>A = (-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>,
      and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test.
      Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      But
      portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>,
      such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear,
      so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point.
      Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
      even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RFW">
      We say that the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
      as a function of <m>x</m>.
      The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
      For the circle,
      we could choose to take the top half as one function of <m>x</m>,
      namely <m>y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}</m> and the bottom half as <m>y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>.
      The equation for the circle defines two
      <em> implicit functions</em> of <m>x</m>.

      and is just one of many fascinating possibilities for implicitly given curves.

    <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
    <p permid="qiG">
      We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
      How can we find a formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
    </p>

    <p permid="WpP">
      By viewing <m>y</m> as an <em>implicit</em>
      function of <m>x</m>,
      we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
      but which we can differentiate.
      Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
      so too its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>,
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, will be
      (at least temporarily)
      unknown.
    </p>

    <p permid="CwY">
      So we view <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m> and
      differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>.
      <me permid="Yfc">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iEh">
      On the right,
      the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
      and on the left we can apply the sum rule,
      so it follows that
      <me permid="Eml">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OLq">
      Note carefully the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x</m>.
      But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
      Recall <xref ref="PA-2-7">Example</xref>,
      where we computed <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]</m>.
      Computing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is the same,
      and requires the chain rule, 
      by which we find that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We now have that
      <me permid="ktu">
        2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uSz">
      We solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by
      subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>.
      <me permid="QAD">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="aZI">
      There are several important things to observe about the result that <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.
      First, this expression for the derivative involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      This makes sense because 
      there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of <m>x</m> between <m>-4</m> and <m>4</m>,
      and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 46%" margins="0%" valign="middle" permid="JrD">
      <p permid="tdm">
        Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles.
        The slope of the radius from the origin to the point <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>m_r = \frac{b}{a}</m>.
        The tangent line to the circle at <m>(a,b)</m> is perpendicular to the radius,
        and thus has slope <m>m_t = -\frac{a}{b}</m>,
        as shown in <xref ref="F-2-7-Circle">Figure</xref>.
        In particular,
        the slope of the tangent line is zero at <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(0,-4)</m>,
        and is undefined at <m>(-4,0)</m> and <m>(4,0)</m>.
        All of these values are consistent with the formula <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.

        <p permid="PQJ">
          We begin by differentiating the curve's equation implicitly.
          Taking the derivative of each side with respect to <m>x</m>,
          <me permid="wHM">
            \frac{d}{dx}\left[ x^3 + y^2 - 2xy \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 2 \right]
          </me>,
          by the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have
          <me permid="cOV">
            \frac{d}{dx}[x^3] + \frac{d}{dx}[y^2] - \frac{d}{dx}[2xy] = 0

        </p>

        <p permid="vXS">
          For the three derivatives we now must execute,
          the first uses the simple power rule,
          the second requires the chain rule
          (since <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>),
          and the third necessitates the product rule
          (again since <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>).
          Applying these rules, we now find that
          <me permid="IWe">
            3x^2 + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} - [2x \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y] = 0

        </p>

        <p permid="cfb">
          We want to solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          To do so, we first collect all of the terms involving
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> on one side of the equation.
          <me permid="pdn">
            2y\frac{dy}{dx} - 2x \frac{dy}{dx}= 2y - 3x^2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Imk">
          Then we factor the left side to isolate <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
          <me permid="Vkw">
            \frac{dy}{dx}(2y - 2x) = 2y - 3x^2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="ott">
          Finally, we divide both sides by <m>(2y - 2x)</m> and conclude that
          <me permid="BrF">
            \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2y-3x^2}{2y-2x}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="UAC">
          Note that the expression for
          <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> depends on both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          To find the slope of the tangent line at <m>(-1,1)</m>,
          we substitute the coordinates into the formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,

          This value matches our visual estimate of the slope of the tangent line shown in <xref ref="F-2-7-Ex1">Figure</xref>.

    <p permid="HgR">
      <xref ref="Ex-2-7-1">Example</xref>
      shows that it is possible when differentiating implicitly to have multiple terms involving <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We use addition and subtraction to collect all terms involving

      then factor to get a single term of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      Finally, we divide to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.

    <p permid="noa">
      We use the notation
      <me permid="NFX">
        \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(a,b)}

      to denote the evaluation of

      This is analogous to writing <m>f'(a)</m> when <m>f'</m> depends on a single variable.
    </p>

    <p permid="Tvj">
      There is a big difference between writing

        \frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + y^2]

      gives an instruction to take the derivative with respect to <m>x</m> of the quantity <m>x^2 + y^2</m>,
      presumably where <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
      On the other hand,
      <me permid="ZUp">
        \frac{dy}{dx}(x^2 + y^2)

      means the product of the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> with the quantity <m>x^2 + y^2</m>.

    <p permid="zCs">
      It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal.
      The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero,
      while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined.
      Often the formula for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is expressed as a quotient of functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, say
      <me permid="Gby">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fJB">
      The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero,
      making the slope of the tangent line zero.
      If we can solve the equation
      <m>p(x,y) = 0</m> for either <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of the other,
      we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve.
      This gives an equation in a single variable,
      and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where <m>p(x,y) = 0</m>.
      At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.
    </p>

    <p permid="LQK">
      Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever
      <m>q(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>p(x,y) \ne 0</m>,
      making the slope undefined.

            From the graph in <xref ref="F-2-7-Act2">Figure</xref>,
            we observe that at each such <m>x</m>-value,
            there are several corresponding <m>y</m>-values for which the tangent line will be horizontal.
            For instance, when <m>x = 0.42265</m>,

    <solution permid="aHW">
      <p permid="KtF">
        First, we compute <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by implicit differentiation.
        Differentiating both sides of the given equation with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>,
        we see that
        <me permid="Yxk">
          6y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} - 5y^4 \frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x
        </me>.
        Removing a factor of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> from the lefthand side and dividing to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we have
        <me permid="EEt">
          \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x}{6y^2 + 2y - 5y^4} = \frac{2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1)}{y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2)}
        </me>.
        The tangent line is potentially horizontal where the numerator of
        <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero and potentially vertical where <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is zero.
        Solving <m>2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1) = 0</m>, we see that
        <me permid="kLC">
          2x(2x-1)(x-1) = 0
        </me>
        so the numerator is zero at <m>x = 0, 0.5, 1</m>.
        The denominator is zero where <m>y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2) = 0</m>.
        Using technology to estimate where <m>-5y^3 + 6y + 2 = 0</m>,
        we see the denominator is zero at <m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="qAO">
        Next, we need to find the coordinates of these points where potential horizontal or vertical tangent lines occur.
        First, we consider the potential horizontal tangent line locations.
        When <m>x = 0</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0</m>,
        and thus we know <m>y^2(2y + 1 - y^3) = 0</m>,
        from which it follows that <m>y = 0</m>,
        <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four points to consider:
        <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(0,-1)</m>,
        <m>(0,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(0,1.618)</m>.
        It is apparent from the graph shown below that the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m> is not horizontal
        (here both the numerator and denominator of <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> are zero),
        but at each of the other three points,
        the tangent line is horizontal.
      </p>

      <p permid="WHX">
        We now reason similarly for the other <m>x</m>-values where the numerator is zero.
        At <m>x = 1</m>, <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 1^4 - 2\cdot 1^3 + 1^2 = 0</m>,
        and here again <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y=-1</m> or <m>y \approx -0.618, 1.618</m>.
        This leads to four potential points where the tangent line is horizontal:
        <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(1,-1)</m>,
        <m>(1,-0.618)</m>, and <m>(1,1.618)</m>.
        At <m>(1,0)</m>, there's not a horizontal tangent line,
        but at each of the others there is, as seen in the figure.
        Similar reasoning when <m>x = 0.5</m> shows that <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 0.5^4 - 2\cdot 0.5^3 + 0.5^2 = 0.625</m>,
        from which we find that <m>y \approx -1.0493, 0.2104, 1.6139</m>,
        and thus the three points <m>(0.5,-1.0493)</m>,
        <m>(0.5,0.2104)</m>, <m>(0.5, 1.6139)</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="CPg">
        Returning to where the denominator is zero (<m>y = 0</m> and <m>y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235</m>),
        we now determine points where the tangent line is vertical.
        Is is apparent from the figure below that there are no vertical tangent lines when <m>y = 0</m> or <m>y \approx -0.856</m>,
        so there are two values to pursue:
        <m>y \approx -0.379, 1.235</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="iWp">
        When <m>y \approx -0.379</m>,
        it follows that <m>2(-0.379)^3+(-0.379)^2-(-0.379)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="QSL">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0.0426
        </me>
        from which we find that <m>x \approx -0.1756, 0.2912, 0.7088, 1.1756</m>.
        The figure confirms that there are vertical tangent lines at <m>(-0.1756,-0.379)</m>,
        <m>(0.2912,-0.379)</m>, <m>(0.7088,-0.379)</m>,
        and <m>(1.1756,-0.379)</m>
      </p>

      <p permid="Pdy">
        Lastly, when <m>y \approx 1.235</m>,
        it follows <m>2(1.235)^3+(1.235)^2-(1.235)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2</m>, so
        <me permid="wZU">
          x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 2.4195
        </me>
        and thus via technology, <m>x \approx -0.8437, 1.8437</m>.
        This leads to two additional points at which the tangent line is vertical:
        <m>(-0.8437, 1.235)</m> and <m>(1.8437, 1.235)</m>.

              Taking the natural log of both sides,
              <m>\ln(y) = \ln(a^x) = x \ln(a)</m>.
              Thus, it follows that

              Differentiating both sides with respect to <m>x</m> while treating <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m> (and again remembering that <m>\ln(a)</m> is constant), we have

              But recall from the outset that <m>y = a^x</m>, and thus
              <me permid="ufo">
