  <introduction permid="VFV">
    <p permid="FrE">
      In all of our studies with derivatives so far,
      we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of <m>x</m>.
      But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are impossible to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.

      <image width="100%" source="images/2_7_Intro" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="lyN">
      Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles.
      Because of the circle's symmetry,
      for each <m>x</m> value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter,
      there are two corresponding <m>y</m>-values.
      For instance, in <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>,
      we have labeled <m>A = (-3,\sqrt{7})</m> and <m>B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})</m>,
      and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test.
      Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <m>y = f(x)</m>.
      But
      portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>,
      such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <xref ref="F-2-7-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear,
      so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point.
      Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> at any point on the circle,
      even though we cannot write <m>y</m> explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="RFW">
      We say that the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m> defines <m>y</m> <em>implicitly</em>
      as a function of <m>x</m>.
      The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of <m>x</m>.
      For the circle,
      we could choose to take the top half as one function of <m>x</m>,
      namely <m>y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}</m> and the bottom half as <m>y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}</m>.
      The equation for the circle defines two
      <em> implicit functions</em> of <m>x</m>.

      and is just one of many fascinating possibilities for implicitly given curves.

    <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
    <p permid="qiG">
      We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle given by <m>x^2 + y^2 = 16</m>.
      How can we find a formula for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>?
    </p>

    <p permid="WpP">
      By viewing <m>y</m> as an <em>implicit</em>
      function of <m>x</m>,
      we think of <m>y</m> as some function whose formula <m>f(x)</m> is unknown,
      but which we can differentiate.
      Just as <m>y</m> represents an unknown formula,
      so too its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>,
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, will be
      (at least temporarily)
      unknown.
    </p>

    <p permid="CwY">
      So we view <m>y</m> as an unknown differentiable function of <m>x</m> and
      differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>.
      <me permid="Yfc">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="iEh">
      On the right,
      the derivative of the constant <m>16</m> is <m>0</m>,
      and on the left we can apply the sum rule,
      so it follows that
      <me permid="Eml">
        \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OLq">
      Note carefully the different roles being played by <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Because <m>x</m> is the independent variable,
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x</m>.
      But <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>y</m> is an implicit function of <m>x</m>.
      Recall <xref ref="PA-2-7">Example</xref>,
      where we computed <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]</m>.
      Computing <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]</m> is the same,
      and requires the chain rule, 
      by which we find that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We now have that
      <me permid="ktu">
        2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uSz">
      We solve this equation for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> by
      subtracting <m>2x</m> from both sides and dividing by <m>2y</m>.
      <me permid="QAD">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="aZI">
      There are several important things to observe about the result that <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.
      First, this expression for the derivative involves both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      This makes sense because 
      there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of <m>x</m> between <m>-4</m> and <m>4</m>,
      and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 46%" margins="0%" valign="middle" permid="JrD">
      <p permid="tdm">
        Second, this formula is entirely consistent with our understanding of circles.
        The slope of the radius from the origin to the point <m>(a,b)</m> is <m>m_r = \frac{b}{a}</m>.
        The tangent line to the circle at <m>(a,b)</m> is perpendicular to the radius,
        and thus has slope <m>m_t = -\frac{a}{b}</m>,
        as shown in <xref ref="F-2-7-Circle">Figure</xref>.
        In particular,
        the slope of the tangent line is zero at <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(0,-4)</m>,
        and is undefined at <m>(-4,0)</m> and <m>(4,0)</m>.
        All of these values are consistent with the formula <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}</m>.

          by the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have

          and the third necessitates the product rule
          (again since <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>).
          Applying these rules, we now find that

      <xref ref="Ex-2-7-1">Example</xref>

    <p permid="zCs">
      It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal.
      The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero,
      while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined.
      Often the formula for
      <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> is expressed as a quotient of functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, say
      <me permid="Gby">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="fJB">
      The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero,
      making the slope of the tangent line zero.
      If we can solve the equation
      <m>p(x,y) = 0</m> for either <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in terms of the other,
      we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve.
      This gives an equation in a single variable,
      and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where <m>p(x,y) = 0</m>.
      At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.
    </p>

    <p permid="LQK">
      Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever
      <m>q(x,y) = 0</m> and <m>p(x,y) \ne 0</m>,
      making the slope undefined.

            From the graph in <xref ref="F-2-7-Act2">Figure</xref>,
            we observe that at each such <m>x</m>-value,
            there are several corresponding <m>y</m>-values for which the tangent line will be horizontal.
            For instance, when <m>x = 0.42265</m>,

            Differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>,
            <me permid="GjY">
              \frac{d}{dx}[x^3 - y^3] = \frac{d}{dx}[6xy]
            </me>,
            so that by the chain and product rules we have
            <me permid="mrh">
              3x^2 - 3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x\frac{dy}{dx}+ 6y
            </me>.
            Rearranging to get all terms with
            <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> on the same side, it follows that
            <me permid="Syq">
              -3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} - 6x\frac{dy}{dx} = 6y-3x^2
            </me>,
            and thus
            <me permid="yFz">
              \frac{dy}{dx}(-3y^2 - 6x) = 6y-3x^2
            </me>.
            Finally, we have established that
            <me permid="eMI">
              \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{6y-3x^2}{-3y^2 - 6x}
            </me>,
            so evaluating at
            <m>(-3,3)</m>, we have
            <m>\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(-3,3)} = \frac{6(3)-3(-3)^2}{-3(3)^2 - 6(-3)} = 1</m>.
            Thus,
            the tangent line has equation <m>y - 3 = 1(x+3)</m>.

            After differentiating with respect to <m>x</m>, we have
            <me permid="KTR">
              \cos(y) \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 1
            </me>.
            Taking the usual steps to solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>,
            we find that
            <me permid="rba">
              \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2 + 1}{\cos(y) + 1}
            </me>.
            Evaluating the slope of the tangent line at
            <m>(0,0)</m>, we have
            <m>\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(0,0)} = \frac{1}{2}</m>,
            and thus the tangent line at <m>(0,0)</m> has equation <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x</m>.

            When we differentiate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>,
            <me permid="Xij">
              \frac{d}{dx}[3x e^{-xy}] = \frac{d}{dx}[y^2]
            </me>,
            we first observe that the product rule is needed on the left and the chain rule on the right.
            Applying those rules, we have
            <me permid="Dps">
              3x\frac{d}{dx}[e^{-xy}] + 3e^{-xy} = 2y\frac{dy}{dx}
            </me>.
            Next,
            we apply the chain rule to differentiate <m>e^{-xy}</m>,
            which yields
            <me permid="jwB">
              3xe^{-xy}\frac{d}{dx}[-xy] + 3e^{-xy} = 2y\frac{dy}{dx}
            </me>.
            Finally, to complete the process of differentiation,
            we use the product rule and get
            <me permid="PDK">
              3xe^{-xy}(-x\frac{dy}{dx} - y) + 3e^{-xy} = 2y\frac{dy}{dx}
            </me>.
            To solve for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, we first expand to have
            <me permid="vKT">
              3x^2e^{-xy}\frac{dy}{dx} - 3xye^{-xy} + 3e^{-xy} = 2y\frac{dy}{dx}
            </me>,
            and then the usual algebraic work may be done to deduce that
            <me permid="bSc">
              \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3xye^{-xy} - 3e^{-xy}}{3x^2e^{-xy}-2y}
            </me>.
            Evaluating at the point
            <m>(0.571433,1)</m>,
            it follows that the slope of the tangent line is
            <me permid="HZl">
              \left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(0.571433,1)} = \frac{3 \cdot 0.571433 e^{-0.571433} - 3 e^{-0.571433}}{3(0.571433)^2e^{-0.571433}-2} \approx 0.501835
            </me>.
            Thus,
            the tangent line is given by <m>y - 1 = 0.501835(x - 0.571433)</m>.

            In an equation involving <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> where portions of the graph can be defined by explicit functions of <m>x</m>,

            A good example of such a curve is the unit circle.
