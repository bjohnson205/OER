    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          What is a left-hand limit at <m>x = a</m> and a right-hand limit at <m>x = a</m>?
        
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
            What does it mean graphically to say that <m>f</m> has limit <m>L</m> as <m>x \to a</m>?
          How is this connected to having a left-hand limit at <m>x = a</m> and having a right-hand limit at <m>x = a</m>?

            How are limits connected to continuity?
