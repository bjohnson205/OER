      Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations,
      say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases.
      Think about the Pythagorean Theorem:
      it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle,
      but rather a fact about <em>every</em> right triangle.
      In the next part of our studies,
      we use calculus to make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more parameters.
      People who use applied mathematics,
      such as engineers and economists,
      often encounter the same types of functions where only small changes to certain constants occur.
      These constants are called <em>parameters</em>.

    <p permid="tkD">
      You are already familiar with certain families of functions.
      For example,
      <m>f(t) = a \sin(b(t-c)) + d</m> is a stretched and shifted version of the sine function with amplitude <m>a</m>,
      period <m>\frac{2\pi}{b}</m>,
      phase shift <m>c</m>, and vertical shift <m>d</m>.
      We know that <m>a</m> affects the size of the oscillation,
      <m>b</m> the rapidity of oscillation,
      and <m>c</m> where the oscillation starts,
      as shown in <xref ref="F-3-2-SineFam">Figure</xref>,
      while <m>d</m> affects the vertical positioning of the graph.
    </p>

    <p permid="ZrM">
      As another example, every function of the form
      <m>y = mx + b</m> is a line with slope <m>m</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,b)</m>.
      The value of <m>m</m> affects the line's steepness,
      and the value of <m>b</m> situates the line vertically on the coordinate axes.
      These two parameters describe all possible non-vertical lines.
    </p>

    <p permid="FyV">
      For other less familiar families of functions,
      we can use calculus to discover where key behavior occurs:
      where members of the family are increasing or decreasing,
      concave up or concave down,
      where relative extremes occur, and more,
      all in terms of the parameters involved.
      To get started,
      we revisit a common collection of functions to see how calculus confirms things we already know.

    <title>Describing families of functions in terms of parameters</title>
    <p permid="RNn">
      Our goal is to describe the key characteristics of the overall behavior of each member of a family of functions in terms of its parameters.
      By finding the first and second derivatives and constructing sign charts
      (each of which may depend on one or more of the parameters),
      we can often make broad conclusions about how each member of the family will appear.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="Ex-3-2-1" permid="kWk">
      <statement>
        <p permid="gWl">
          Consider the two-parameter family of functions given by <m>g(x) = axe^{-bx}</m>,
          where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive real numbers.
          Fully describe the behavior of a typical member of the family in terms of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>,
          including the location of all critical numbers,
          where <m>g</m> is increasing, decreasing, concave up,
          and concave down, and the long term behavior of <m>g</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="drL">
        <p permid="SSG">
          We begin by computing <m>g'(x)</m>.
          By the product rule,
          <me permid="KiO">
            g'(x) = ax \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-bx}\right] + e^{-bx} \frac{d}{dx}[ax]
          </me>.
          By applying the chain rule and constant multiple rule,
          we find that
          <me permid="qpX">
            g'(x) = axe^{-bx}(-b) + e^{-bx}(a)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="yZP">
          To find the critical numbers of <m>g</m>,
          we solve the equation <m>g'(x) = 0</m>.
          By factoring <m>g'(x)</m>, we find
          <me permid="Wxg">
            0 = ae^{-bx}(-bx + 1)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="fgY">
          Since we are given that <m>a \ne 0</m> and we know that
          <m>e^{-bx} \ne 0</m> for all values of <m>x</m>,
          the only way this equation can hold is when <m>-bx + 1 = 0</m>.
          Solving for <m>x</m>, we find <m>x = \frac{1}{b}</m>,
          and this is therefore the only critical number of <m>g</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="Loh">
          We construct the first derivative sign chart for <m>g</m> that is shown in <xref ref="F-3-2-signchartg">Figure</xref>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F-3-2-signchartg" permid="oAK">
          <caption>The first derivative sign chart for <m>g(x) = axe^{-bx}</m>.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="images/3_2_signchartg" />
        </figure>

        <p permid="rvq">
          Because the factor <m>ae^{-bx}</m> is always positive,
          the sign of <m>g'</m> depends on the linear factor <m>(1-bx)</m>,
          which is positive for
          <m>x \lt \frac{1}{b}</m> and negative for <m>x \gt \frac{1}{b}</m>.
          Hence we can not only conclude that <m>g</m> is always increasing for
          <m>x \lt \frac{1}{b}</m> and decreasing for <m>x \gt \frac{1}{b}</m>,
          but also that <m>g</m> has a global maximum at
          <m>(\frac{1}{b}, g(\frac{1}{b}))</m> and no local minimum.
        </p>

        <p permid="XCz">
          We turn next to analyzing the concavity of <m>g</m>.
          With <m>g'(x) = -abxe^{-bx} + ae^{-bx}</m>,
          we differentiate to find that
          <me permid="CEp">
            g''(x) = -abxe^{-bx}(-b) + e^{-bx}(-ab) + ae^{-bx}(-b)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="DJI">
          Combining like terms and factoring, we now have
          <me permid="iLy">
            g''(x) = ab^2xe^{-bx} - 2abe^{-bx} = abe^{-bx}(bx - 2)
          </me>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F-3-2-signchartg2" permid="UHT">
          <caption>The second derivative sign chart for <m>g(x) = axe^{-bx}</m>.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="images/3_2_signchartg2" />
        </figure>

        <p permid="jQR">
          We observe that <m>abe^{-bx}</m> is always positive,
          and thus the sign of <m>g''</m> depends on the sign of <m>(bx-2)</m>,
          which is zero when <m>x = \frac{2}{b}</m>.
          Since <m>b</m> is positive,
          the value of <m>(bx-2)</m> is negative for
          <m>x \lt \frac{2}{b}</m> and positive for <m>x \gt \frac{2}{b}</m>.
          The sign chart for <m>g''</m> is shown in <xref ref="F-3-2-signchartg2">Figure</xref>.
          Thus, <m>g</m> is concave down for all
          <m>x \lt \frac{2}{b}</m> and concave up for all <m>x \gt \frac{2}{b}</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="PYa">
          Finally, we analyze the long term behavior of <m>g</m> by considering two limits.
          First, we note that
          <me permid="OSH">
            \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} axe^{-bx} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{ax}{e^{bx}}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="wfj">
          This limit has indeterminate form <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m>, so 
          we apply L'Hpital's Rule and find that <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = 0</m>.
          In the other direction,
          <me permid="uZQ">
            \lim_{x \to -\infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} axe^{-bx} = -\infty
          </me>,
          because <m>ax \to -\infty</m> and
          <m>e^{-bx} \to \infty</m> as <m>x \to -\infty</m>.
          Hence, as we move left on its graph,
          <m>g</m> decreases without bound,
          while as we move to the right, <m>g(x) \to 0</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="cms">
          All of this information now helps us produce the graph of a typical member of this family of functions without using a graphing utility
          (and without choosing particular values for <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>),
          as shown in <xref ref="F-3-2-SurgeFam">Figure</xref>.
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="F-3-2-SurgeFam" permid="APc">
          <caption>The graph of <m>g(x) = axe^{-bx}</m>.</caption>
          <image width="80%" source="images/3_2_SurgeFam" />
        </figure>

        <p permid="ItB">
          Note that the value of <m>b</m> controls the horizontal location of the global maximum and the inflection point,
          as neither depends on <m>a</m>.
          The value of <m>a</m> affects the vertical stretch of the graph.
          For example,
          the global maximum occurs at the point <m>(\frac{1}{b}, g(\frac{1}{b})) = (\frac{1}{b}, \frac{a}{b}e^{-1})</m>,
          so the larger the value of <m>a</m>,
          the greater the value of the global maximum.

    <p permid="xUw">
      The work we've completed in <xref ref="Ex-3-2-1">Example</xref>
      can often be replicated for other families of functions that depend on parameters.
      Normally we are most interested in determining all critical numbers,
      a first derivative sign chart,
      a second derivative sign chart,
      and the limit of the function as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
      Throughout,
      we prefer to work with the parameters as arbitrary constants.
      In addition,
      we can experiment with some particular values of the parameters present to reduce the algebraic complexity of our work.
      The following activities offer several key examples where we see that the values of the parameters substantially affect the behavior of individual functions within a given family.

            We first note that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m>,
            so to find critical numbers we set
            <m>p'(x) = 0</m> and solve for <m>x</m>.
            This leads to the equation <m>3x^2 - a = 0</m>,
            which implies
            <me permid="EuY">

            If <m>a \gt 0</m>,
            then the solutions to this equation are <m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>;
            if <m>a \lt  0</m>, then the equation has no solution.
            Hence,
            <m>p</m> has two critical numbers (<m>x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>) whenever <m>a \gt 0</m> and no critical numbers when <m>a \lt  0</m>.

            For the case when <m>a \lt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is positive for every value of <m>x</m>,
            and thus <m>p</m> is always increasing and has no relative extreme values.
            (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart,
            and <m>p'</m> is always positive.)
            For the case when <m>a\gt 0</m>,
            we observe that <m>p'(x) = 3x^2 - a</m> is a concave up parabola with zeros at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.
            It follows that for <m>x \lt -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>,
            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is increasing);

            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m> (so <m>p</m> is decreasing);

            <m>p'(x)\gt 0</m>
            (so <m>p</m> is again increasing).
            In this situation, we see that <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
            <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m> and a relative minimum at <m>x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}</m>.

            Note that <m>p''(x) = 0</m> when <m>x = 0</m> and that
            <m>p''(x) \lt 0</m> for <m>x \lt 0</m> and <m>p''(x)\gt 0</m> for <m>x\gt 0</m>.

            By the chain rule and treating <m>A</m>, <m>c</m>,

            Since <m>A</m>, <m>c</m>,

            the only way <m>L''(t) = 0</m> is if <m>ce^{-kt}-1 = 0</m>.
            Solving <m>ce^{-kt}-1 = 0</m> for <m>t</m>,
            we first write <m>e^{-kt} = \frac{1}{c}</m>.
            Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

            the quantity <m>ce^{-kt} - 1</m> will be positive to the left of where it is zero and negative to the right of where it is zero.
            Since this is the only term in <m>L''(t)</m> that can change sign,
            it follows that <m>L''(t) \gt 0</m> for <m>t \lt  -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)</m> and

            </me>.
            Thus,
            the inflection point on the graph of <m>L</m> is located at  <m>( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right), \frac{A}{2})</m>.

            which we note lies vertically halfway between the asymptotes.
            In addition, we see that <m>L(0) = \frac{A}{1+c}</m>.
            The combination of all of this information shows us that a typical graph in this family of functions is given by the following figure.

              Thus, <m>\lim_{x \to c^+} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = \infty</m> and <m>\lim_{x \to c^-} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = -\infty</m>.
              This makes the line <m>x=c</m> a vertical asymptote for <m>q</m>.

              We can write <m>q(x)</m> as
              <m>q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}</m> and thus see the denominator increases without bound as <m>x \to \infty</m>.
              Therefore, <m>\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = 0</m>.
              This makes the line <m>y=0</m> a horizontal asymptote for <m>q</m>.

              As <m>x \to -\infty</m>,
              <m>e^{-x}</m> increases without bound,
              while <m>(x-c)</m> decreases without bound.
              Thus, <m>q</m> has an indeterminate form as <m>x \to -infty</m>.
              Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us

              Using <m>q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}</m>,

              The function <m>q</m> has critical points in its domain where
              <m>q'(x) = 0</m> or <m>q'(x)</m> doesn't exist.
              Note that <m>q'(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=c</m>,
              but <m>c</m> is not in the domain of mq.
              Thus, the only critical points of <m>q</m> occur when <m>q'(x)=0</m>.
              The only way the fraction <m>q'(x)</m> can be <m>0</m> is if the numerator is <m>0</m>.
              Since <m>x-c+1=0</m> when <m>x=c-1</m>,
              the only critical number for <m>q</m> is <m>x=c-1</m>.

              The values of the exponential function <m>e^x</m> and the quadratic <m>(x-c)^2</m> are positive for <m>x \neq c</m>,
              so the sign of <m>q'(x) = -\frac{x-c+1}{(x-c)^2e^x}</m> depends entirely on the sign of <m>x-(c-1)</m>.
              When <m>x \lt c-1</m> we see that <m>q'(x) \gt 0</m> and when
              <m>x \gt c-1</m> we have <m>q'(x) \lt 0</m>.
              Thus, <m>q</m> is increasing on
              <m>(-\infty,
              c-1)</m> and is decreasing on <m>(c-1,c)</m>,
              so it follows that <m>q(c-1)</m> is a relative maximum value.
              This value is a local maximum,
              since the value of <m>q</m> can be made as large as we like as shown in part (b).
