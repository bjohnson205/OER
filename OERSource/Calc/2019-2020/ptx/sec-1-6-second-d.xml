    <p permid="YsX">
      Given a differentiable function <m>y= f(x)</m>,
      we know that its derivative, <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      is a related function whose output at <m>x=a</m> tells us the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      That is, heights on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.
    </p>

    <p permid="EAg">
      At a point where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> is positive.
      Therefore, on an interval where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing
      (or rising).
          <idx><h>increasing</h></idx>
      Similarly,
      if <m>f'(x)</m> is negative on an interval,
      the graph of <m>f</m> is decreasing
          <idx><h>decreasing</h></idx>
      (or falling).
    </p>

    <p permid="kHp">
      The derivative of <m>f</m> tells us not only <em>whether</em>
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing on an interval,
      but also <em>how</em> the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.
      Look at the two tangent lines shown in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      We see that at point <m>A</m>
      the value of <m>f'(x)</m> is positive and relatively close to zero,
      and at that point the graph is rising slowly.
      By contrast, at point <m>B</m>,
      the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value,
      and <m>f</m> is decreasing rapidly at <m>B</m>.

    <p permid="QOy">
      Besides asking whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether it is large or small,
      we can also ask <q>how is the derivative changing?</q>
    </p>

    <p permid="wVH">
      Because the derivative,
      <m>y = f'(x)</m>, is itself a function,
      we can consider taking its derivative <mdash /> the derivative of the derivative <mdash /> and ask
      <q>what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves?</q>
      We start with an investigation of a moving object.

      So far,

      the sign of the derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing.

      as well as the instantaneous rate of change of <m>y = f'(x)</m>.
      In other words,
      just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes,
      the <em>second</em> derivative measures the rate at which the <em>first</em> derivative changes.
      The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.

      In addition to asking <em>whether</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing,
      it is also natural to inquire <em>how</em>
      a function is increasing or decreasing.
      There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval,
      as pictured below in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>:
      the function can increase more and more rapidly,
      it can increase at the same rate,
      or it can increase in a way that is slowing down.
      Fundamentally,
      we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends,
      with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all.
      More than this,
      we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.

      <image width="100%" source="images/1_6_3optsi" />
    </figure>

    <p permid="mwC">
      On the leftmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve.
      As we move from left to right,
      the slopes of those tangent lines will increase.
      Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing,
      and this explains why we say this function is
      <em>increasing at an increasing rate</em>.
      For the rightmost graph in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsi">Figure</xref>,
      observe that as <m>x</m> increases,
      the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease.
      This function is <em>increasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="SDL">
      Similar options hold for how a function can decrease.
      Here we must be extra careful with our language,
      because decreasing functions involve negative slopes<fn>
      Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language.
      For example, it can be tempting to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is bigger than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      But we must remember that <q>greater than</q>
      describes how numbers lie on a number line:
      <m>x \gt y</m> provided that <m>x</m> lies to the right of <m>y</m>.
      So of course, <m>-100</m> is less than <m>-2</m>.
      Informally, it might be helpful to say that
      <q><m>-100</m> is more negative than <m>-2</m>.</q>
      </fn>.
      When a function's values are negative,
      and those values get more negative as the input increases,
      the function must be decreasing.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="F-1-6-3optsd" permid="PJf">
      <caption>From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.</caption>

    <p permid="yKU">
      Now consider the three graphs shown above in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref>.
      The middle graph clearly depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate.
      Now, on the first curve, draw a sequence of tangent lines.
      We see that the slopes of these lines get closer to zero <mdash /> meaning they get
      less and less negative <mdash /> as we move from left to right.
      That means that the values of the first derivative,
      while all negative, are increasing,
      and thus we say that the leftmost curve is
      <em>decreasing at an increasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="eSd">
      This leaves only the rightmost curve in <xref ref="F-1-6-3optsd">Figure</xref> to consider.
      For that function,
      the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval,
      but as we move from left to right,
      the slopes get more and more negative as they get steeper.
      Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing,
      and we say that the function is
      <em>decreasing at a decreasing rate</em>.
    </p>

    <p permid="KZm">
      We now introduce the notion of <em>concavity</em>
          <idx><h>concavity</h></idx>
      which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors.
      When a curve opens upward on a given interval,
      like the parabola <m>y = x^2</m> or the exponential growth function <m>y = e^x</m>,
      we say that the curve is <em>concave up</em> on that interval.
      Likewise, when a curve opens down,
      like the parabola <m>y = -x^2</m> or the negative exponential function <m>y = -e^{x}</m>,
      we say that the function is <em>concave down</em>.
      Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.
    </p>

    <p permid="rgv">
      In <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref> below,
      we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each.
      The lefthand plot shows a function that is concave up; observe that here the tangent lines
      always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing
      as we move from left to right.
      In other words,
      the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is increasing on that interval.
      Similarly, the righthand plot in <xref ref="F-1-6-concavity">Figure</xref>
      depicts a function that is concave down;
      in this case we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve
      and the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right.
      The fact that its derivative,
      <m>f'</m>, is decreasing makes <m>f</m> concave down on the interval shown.

            and <m>9\lt t\lt 10.1</m>. This is because the curve
            <m>y = s(t)</m> is concave up on these intervals, which corresponds to an increasing first derivative <m>y =s'(t)</m>.
            Similarly,
            <m>y = v(t)</m> appears to be decreasing on the intervals <m>1.1\lt t\lt 2</m>,
            <m>4.1\lt t\lt 5</m>, <m>7.1\lt t\lt 8</m>,
            and <m>10.1\lt t\lt 11</m>. This is due to the curve
            <m>y = s(t)</m> being concave down on these intervals, corresponding to a decreasing first derivative <m>y =s'(t)</m>.
            On the intervals <m>2\lt t\lt 3</m>, <m>5\lt t\lt 6</m>,
            <m>8\lt t\lt 9</m>, and <m>11\lt t\lt 12</m>,
            the curve <m>y = s(t)</m> is constant, and thus linear,
            so <m>s</m> is neither concave up nor concave down. On these intervals, then, the velocity function is constant.

      Exploring the context of position, velocity,

      and essentially all the same observations hold.

      on an interval where the graph of <m>y=f(x)</m> is concave up,
      <m>f'</m> is increasing and <m>f''</m> is positive.

            A differentiable function <m>f</m> is increasing at a point or on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive,

            By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function <m>f</m>,
            we arrive at the second derivative, <m>f''</m>.
            The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative.
            The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.

            A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing
            (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is positive),
            and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing
            (or equivalently whenever its second derivative is negative).
            Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are <m>y = x^2</m> and <m>y = e^x</m>;
            examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are <m>y = -x^2</m> and <m>y = -e^x</m>.

            The units on the second derivative are
            <q>units of output per unit of input per unit of input.</q>
            They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input.
            In other words,
            the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.
