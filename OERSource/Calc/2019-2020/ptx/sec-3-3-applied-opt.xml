          In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought,
          how do we develop a function that models the situation and use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?

  <introduction permid="yiR">
    <p permid="dkH">
      Near the conclusion of <xref ref="sec-3-3-optimization">Section</xref>,
      we considered two optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem.
      In <xref ref="Ex-3-3-1">Example</xref>,
      we sought to use a single piece of wire to build an equilateral triangle and square
      in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed.
      In the subsequent <xref ref="act-3-3-3">Example</xref>,
      we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.
    </p>

    <p permid="JrQ">
      In neither of these problems was a function to optimize explicitly provided.
      Rather, we first tried to understand the problem by
      drawing a figure and introducing variables,
      and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity
      to be optimized.
      Once the function was established,
      we then considered what domain was appropriate.
      At that point,
      we were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.

      Throughout what follows in the current section,
      the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems.
      Initially, some substantial guidance is provided,
      with the problems progressing to require greater independence as we move along.

      Many of the steps in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>

              Draw a picture and introduce variables.
              It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.
              Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step.
              Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation.
              A nice example of this can be seen at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/99">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</url>,
              where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.

              Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.
              Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced:
              one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought,
              and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.

              Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized;
              this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.
              For example, in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>,
              we initially found that <m>V = x^2 y</m>,
              but then the additional relationship that <m>4x + y = 108</m>
              (girth plus length equals 108 inches)
              allows us to relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and thus observe equivalently that <m>y = 108-4x</m>.
              Substituting for <m>y</m> in the volume equation yields <m>V(x) = x^2(108-4x)</m>,
              and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable <m>x</m>.

              Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.
              Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.
              Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.

          <li permid="HCD">
            <p permid="EHX">
              Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.
              This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first.
              Then, depending on the domain,
              we either construct a first derivative sign chart
              (for an open or unbounded interval)
              or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers
              (for a closed, bounded interval),
              using ideas we've studied so far in <xref ref="C-3">Chapter</xref>.

              Finally, we make certain we have answered the question:
              does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
              or the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
              That is,
              finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.

            Substituting this expression for <m>h</m> in the formula for total cost,

            At this point,

            In addition, we note that since <m>h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}</m>,
            the corresponding <m>h</m> value is <m>h \approx 4.041337</m>,

  </answer>
  <solution permid="sgT">
    <p permid="kCu">
      We begin by letting <m>x</m> be the distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>Q</m>.
      Since it is 3 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
      the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> is <m>3-x</m>.
      Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
      the distance from <m>Z</m> to the cabin is <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="QJD">
      Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of <m>x</m>.
      Because distance equals rate times time,
      time is thus distance divided by rate.
      Along the road,
      the hiker's distance is <m>3-x</m> km and her rate is <m>8</m> km/hr,
      thus her time on the road, <m>T_r</m> is
      <me permid="Gky">
        T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wQM">
      Once she enters the woods,
      her rate drops to <m>3</m> km/hr and travels a distance of <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m> km,
      making her time in the woods, <m>T_w</m>, given by
      <me permid="mrH">
        T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="cXV">
      Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function
      <me permid="SyQ">
        T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Jfe">
      Because the only values of <m>x</m> that make sense to use are <m>0 \le x \le 3</m>
      (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip),
      we use this domain for <m>T</m> and now seek the absolute minimum of <m>T</m> on <m>[0,3]</m>.
      First, we find that
      <me permid="yFZ">
        T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pmn">
      Setting <m>T'(x) = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>,
      we have <m>\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}</m>,
      so <m>8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
      Squaring both sides, <m>64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2</m>.
      Hence, <m>55x^2 = 36</m>,
      so <m>x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904</m>.
      (We don't consider the critical number
      <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}</m> because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of <m>T</m>.)
    </p>

    <p permid="Vtw">
      Finally, we evaluate <m>T</m> at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints.
      Doing so, we find <m>T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417</m>,
      <m>T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.20185</m>,
      and <m>T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302</m>,
      and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is <m>0.99302</m> hours,
      which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.

      <p permid="FRq">
        We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend <dollar />15.
        This cost constraint implies that

        </me>,
        which allows us to express <m>h</m> as a function of <m>x</m> by solving for <m>h</m>.
        Doing so, we see that <m>12xh = 15 - 3x^2</m>, so

        Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume,

        Subsituting the expression for <m>h</m>, we have

        Note particularly that in order to have a box,

        The latter condition along with the fact that

        It is apparent that the box vanishes

        and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number.
        Differentiating <m>V</m>,
        we find that <m>V'(x) = \frac{15}{12} - \frac{3}{4}x^2</m>.
        Solving <m>V'(x) = 0</m> to find all critical numbers of <m>V</m> in the domain,

        Noting that the absolute minimum volume <m>V = 0</m> occurs at each endpoint,
        it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is <m>V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583</m> cubic feet.

        The farmer will fence a rectangular area whose length <m>x</m> and width <m>y</m> are unknown.
        The total area of the rectangular area is composed of 4 equal area rectangles.
        There are two ways to do this as shown in the figure below.

        We want to maximize the area of each subrectangular region,
        which is the same as maximizing the total area 
        <m>A = xy</m> of the entire rectangular region.
        Since <m>A</m> has two variables,
        we can't yet directly apply calculus techniques to it.
        We use the information about the amount of fencing to relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in order to write <m>A</m> in terms of just one variable.

      <p permid="eua">
        In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure,
        the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is <m>2x+5y</m>.
        We assume that all of the <m>7500</m> feet of fencing will be used,
        so <m>2x+5y=7500</m>.
        Solving for <m>x</m>, <m>x = 3750 - 2.5y</m>.
        Substituting this expression for <m>x</m> into the area formula allows us to write <m>A</m> in terms of <m>y</m> alone:
        <me permid="BRr">
          A(y) = (3750-2.5y)y = 3750y - 2.5y^2
        </me>.
        To enclose any area,
        we of course must have <m>y \gt 0</m> and <m>x \gt 0</m>,
        and since <m>x = 3750 - 2.5y</m>,
        it follows that we need to have
        <m>2.5y \lt 3750</m> so <m>y \lt 1500</m>.
        To find the maximum value of <m>A</m> on this domain,
        we find the critical numbers of <m>A</m>.
        Since <m>A'(y) = 3750 - 5y</m>,
        we see that <m>A'(y) = 0</m> when and only when <m>y = 750</m>.
        For <m>0 \lt y \lt 750</m>,
        we see that <m>A'(y) \gt 0</m> and for
        <m>750 \lt y \lt 1500</m> we have <m>A'(y) \lt 0</m>.
        So <m>A(750) = 1406250</m> square feet is the absolute maximum value of <m>A</m>.
        The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total,

        so <m>3x + 3y = 7500</m>.
        Solving for <m>x</m> and substituting into <m>A</m>,
        we find <m>x = 2500 - y</m> and

    <solution permid="Bhx">
      <p permid="WPB">
        We start by constructing a careful diagram of the overall situation.
        Let <m>x</m> be the distance from the first pole to the second pole where the cable touches the ground,
        and let <m>y</m> be the length of the cable from the top of the first tower to the ground,
        and <m>z</m> the length of cable from the ground to the top of the second tower,
        as pictured in the following figure.
        Note that we have included the given heights of the towers and the distance between them.

      <p permid="CWK">
        The total amount of cable, <m>L</m>, used
        (which we wish to minimize)
        is given by <m>L = y + z</m>.
        We can use the geometry of the situation to write both <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
        In the first right triangle,
        by the Pythagorean Theorem we know that <m>x^2 + 60^2 = y^2</m>,
        and thus <m>y = \sqrt{x^2 + 3600}</m>.
        In the second right triangle,
        note that the horizontal leg of the triangle has length <m>100-x</m>,
        and thus <m>(100-x)^2 + 80^2 = z^2</m>,
        so <m>z = \sqrt{(100-x)^2 + 6400}</m>.
        It follows that with <m>L = y + z</m>,
        <me permid="OfJ">
          L(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 3600} + \sqrt{6400 + (100-x)^2}
        </me>.
        It is also apparent from the given situation that the relevant domain for <m>L</m> is <m>0 \le x \le 100</m>.
        Given that we want to minimize <m>L</m> on this closed interval,
        it remains to find any critical numbers of <m>L</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="jdT">
        We note by the chain rule that
        <me permid="umS">
          L'(x) = \frac{2x}{2(x^2+3600)^{1/2}} + \frac{-2(100-x)}{2((100-x)^2 + 6400)^{1/2}}
        </me>
        We use technology to solve the equation
        <m>L'(x) = 0</m> and find that it has a single solution in the interval <m>0 \le x \le 100</m>:
        <m>x \approx 42.85714</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Plc">
        To find the absolute minimum of <m>L</m> on the relevant domain,
        we evaluate <m>L</m> at the endpoints and the only critical number.
        Doing so, we fine <m>L(0) \approx 188.062</m>,
        <m>L(100) \approx 196.619</m>,
        and <m>L(42.85714) \approx 172.047</m>.
        Hence the least amount of cable we can use is approximately <m>172.047</m> feet and is accomplished by anchoring the cable about
        <m>42.85714</m> feet from the first tower.

    <statement>
      <p permid="xhy">
        A company is designing propane tanks that are cylindrical with hemispherical ends.
        Assume that the company wants tanks that will hold 1000 cubic feet of gas,
        and that the ends are more expensive to make,
        costing <dollar />5 per square foot,
        while the cylindrical barrel between the ends costs <dollar />2 per square foot.
        Use calculus to determine the minimum cost to construct such a tank.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <answer permid="tCY">
      <p permid="YEO">
        The minimum cost is <dollar />1165.70.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution permid="NvP">
      <p permid="vsl">
        We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be <m>h</m> with the radius of the cylinder given by <m>r</m>.
        It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also <m>r</m>.
        We first identify formulas for both the volume and surface area of the tank by looking at the cylindrical and hemispherical pieces.
      </p>

      <p permid="bzu">
        The cylindrical part of the tank has volume <m>V_c = \pi r^2 h</m>,
        and the surface area of its sides is <m>A_c = 2\pi r h</m>
        (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle).
        The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere,
        and the volume of a sphere is <m>V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>,
        while the surface area of a sphere is <m>A_s = 4 \pi r^2</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="HGD">
        The overall volume of the tank is therefore
        <me permid="aub">
          V = V_c + V_s = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
        </me>,
        and its total surface area is
        <me permid="GBk">
          A = A_c + A_s = 2\pi r h + 4 \pi r^2
        </me>.
        Moreover, taking into account the different costs of material for the cylindrical sides and hemispherical ends,
        we find that the total cost of the tank is
        <me permid="mIt">
          C = 2(2\pi r h) + 5(4 \pi r^2) = 4 \pi r h + 20 \pi r^2
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="nNM">
        Our goal is to minimize the total cost of the tank given that we want it to hold 1000 cubic meters of volume.
        From this constraint,
        we have the equation <m>1000 = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>,
        which we can solve for <m>h</m> to get <m>\pi r^2 h = 1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>, so
        <me permid="SPC">
          h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}
        </me>.
        This allows us to now write cost as a function of the single variable <m>r</m> by substituting the expression for <m>h</m> into the earlier formula we found for cost.
        In particular,
        <me permid="yWL">
          C(r) = 4 \pi r \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2} + 20 \pi r^2 = 4 \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r} + 20\pi r^2
        </me>
        Simplifying further, we have found that
        <me permid="fdU">
          C(r) = \frac{4000}{r} - \frac{16}{3}\pi r^2 + 20 \pi r^2 = \frac{4000}{r} + \frac{44}{3}r^2
        </me>.
        Based on the physical constraints of the problem,
        we obviously will only consider values of <m>r \gt 0</m> and <m>h \gt 0</m>.
        Since <m>h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}</m>,
        we must have
        <me permid="Lld">
          \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \lt 1000
        </me>
        so <m>r^3 \lt \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1000 = 750</m>,
        and thus <m>r \lt \sqrt[3]{750} \approx 9.086</m>.
        We now work to minimize <m>C(r)</m> on the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="TUV">
        Taking the derivative of <m>C</m>,
        we find that <m>C'(r) = -\frac{4000}{r^2} + \frac{88}{3}r</m>.
        Setting <m>C'(r) = 0</m>, it follows that
        <me permid="rsm">
          \frac{4000}{r^2} = \frac{88}{3}r
        </me>
        and thus
        <me permid="Xzv">
          4000 \cdot \frac{3}{88} = r^3
        </me>.
        Therefore, <m>r^3 = \frac{1500}{11}</m>,
        so <m>r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}} \approx 5.147</m> is the only critical number of <m>C</m>;
        observe that it lies within the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>.
      </p>

      <p permid="Ace">
        If we plot the derivative function, <m>y = C'(r)</m>,
        on the interval <m>0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}</m>,
        we see that for <m>0 \lt r \lt 5.147</m>,
        <m>C'(r) \lt 0</m>,
        and for <m>5.147 \lt r \lt 9.086</m>, <m>C'(r) \gt 0</m>,
        which shows that <m>C</m> is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number,
        and hence <m>C</m> has a global minimum of <m>C(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}}) \approx 1165.70</m>,
        so <dollar />1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.
