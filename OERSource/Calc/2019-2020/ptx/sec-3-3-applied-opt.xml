          In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought,
          how do we develop a function that models the situation and use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?

  <introduction permid="yiR">
    <p permid="dkH">
      Near the conclusion of <xref ref="sec-3-3-optimization">Section</xref>,
      we considered two optimization problems where determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem.
      In <xref ref="Ex-3-3-1">Example</xref>,
      we sought to use a single piece of wire to build an equilateral triangle and square
      in order to maximize the total combined area enclosed.
      In the subsequent <xref ref="act-3-3-3">Example</xref>,
      we investigated how the volume of a box constructed from a piece of cardboard by removing squares from each corner and folding up the sides depends on the size of the squares removed.
    </p>

    <p permid="JrQ">
      In neither of these problems was a function to optimize explicitly provided.
      Rather, we first tried to understand the problem by
      drawing a figure and introducing variables,
      and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity
      to be optimized.
      Once the function was established,
      we then considered what domain was appropriate.
      At that point,
      we were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.

      Throughout what follows in the current section,
      the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems.
      Initially, some substantial guidance is provided,
      with the problems progressing to require greater independence as we move along.

      Many of the steps in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>

              Draw a picture and introduce variables.
              It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables.
              Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step.
              Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation.
              A nice example of this can be seen at <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/99">http://gvsu.edu/s/99</url>,
              where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.

              Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.
              Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced:
              one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought,
              and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.

              Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized;
              this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula.
              For example, in <xref ref="PA-3-4">Example</xref>,
              we initially found that <m>V = x^2 y</m>,
              but then the additional relationship that <m>4x + y = 108</m>
              (girth plus length equals 108 inches)
              allows us to relate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and thus observe equivalently that <m>y = 108-4x</m>.
              Substituting for <m>y</m> in the volume equation yields <m>V(x) = x^2(108-4x)</m>,
              and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable <m>x</m>.

              Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.
              Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on.
              Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.

          <li permid="HCD">
            <p permid="EHX">
              Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.
              This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first.
              Then, depending on the domain,
              we either construct a first derivative sign chart
              (for an open or unbounded interval)
              or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers
              (for a closed, bounded interval),
              using ideas we've studied so far in <xref ref="C-3">Chapter</xref>.

              Finally, we make certain we have answered the question:
              does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity,
              or the values of the variables that produce the maximum?
              That is,
              finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.

            Substituting this expression for <m>h</m> in the formula for total cost,

            At this point,

            In addition, we note that since <m>h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}</m>,
            the corresponding <m>h</m> value is <m>h \approx 4.041337</m>,

  </answer>
  <solution permid="sgT">
    <p permid="kCu">
      We begin by letting <m>x</m> be the distance from <m>Z</m> to <m>Q</m>.
      Since it is 3 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>,
      the distance from <m>P</m> to <m>Z</m> is <m>3-x</m>.
      Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem,
      the distance from <m>Z</m> to the cabin is <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="QJD">
      Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of <m>x</m>.
      Because distance equals rate times time,
      time is thus distance divided by rate.
      Along the road,
      the hiker's distance is <m>3-x</m> km and her rate is <m>8</m> km/hr,
      thus her time on the road, <m>T_r</m> is
      <me permid="Gky">
        T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wQM">
      Once she enters the woods,
      her rate drops to <m>3</m> km/hr and travels a distance of <m>\sqrt{4+x^2}</m> km,
      making her time in the woods, <m>T_w</m>, given by
      <me permid="mrH">
        T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="cXV">
      Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function
      <me permid="SyQ">
        T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="Jfe">
      Because the only values of <m>x</m> that make sense to use are <m>0 \le x \le 3</m>
      (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip),
      we use this domain for <m>T</m> and now seek the absolute minimum of <m>T</m> on <m>[0,3]</m>.
      First, we find that
      <me permid="yFZ">
        T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="pmn">
      Setting <m>T'(x) = 0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>,
      we have <m>\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}</m>,
      so <m>8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}</m>.
      Squaring both sides, <m>64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2</m>.
      Hence, <m>55x^2 = 36</m>,
      so <m>x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904</m>.
      (We don't consider the critical number
      <m>x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}</m> because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of <m>T</m>.)
    </p>

    <p permid="Vtw">
      Finally, we evaluate <m>T</m> at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints.
      Doing so, we find <m>T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417</m>,
      <m>T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.20185</m>,
      and <m>T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302</m>,
      and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is <m>0.99302</m> hours,
      which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.

      Differentiating,

  <solution permid="Fff">
    <p permid="xAG">
      Once we choose the angle <m>\theta</m>,
      the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined,

      Thus, the sum of the areas of the two triangles is <m>\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)</m>,

      Hence, the area of the trapezoidal cross-section is <m>A(\theta) = \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 2 \sin(\theta)</m>.
      Because the length of the trough is constant,
      the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area.

      This most recent equation is quadratic in <m>\cos(\theta)</m>,
