<subsection><title>The Definition of Function</title>
<p>
    We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For example, when a physician prescribes a drug in a certain dosage, she needs to know how long the dose will remain in the bloodstream. A sales manager needs to know how the price of his product will affect its sales. A <term>function</term><idx>function</idx> is a special type of relationship between variables that allows us to make such predictions.</p>

    <title>Definition of Function</title>
    <p>A <term>function</term><idx>function</idx> is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the <term>output</term><idx>output</idx> variable can be determined from a value of the <term>input</term><idx>input</idx> variable.
    </p>
</assemblage>

<p>
    What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a <em>unique value</em>— that is, <em>exactly one value</em> of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.

<example  xml:id="example-functions">
    <p>
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p>The distance, <m>d</m>, traveled by a car in 2 hours is a function of its speed, <m>r</m>. If we know the speed of the car, we can determine the distance it travels by the formula <m>d = r \cdot 2</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>The cost of a fill-up with unleaded gasoline is a function of the number of gallons purchased. The gas pump represents the function by displaying the corresponding values of the input variable (number of gallons) and the output variable (cost).</p></li>
            <li><p>Score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is not a function of score on an IQ test, because two people with the same score on an IQ test may score differently on the SAT; that is, a person’s score on the SAT is not uniquely determined by his or her score on an IQ test.</p></li>

<p>A function can be described in several different ways. In the following examples, we consider functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Functions Defined by Tables</title>
    <p>When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable <em>is a function of</em> the input.</p>

    <example xml:id="example-table-functions"><statement><p>

        <li><p><xref ref="table-auto-sales" text="type-global" /> shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, <m>S</m>, <em>is a function of</em> <m>t</m>.</p>

        <p>According to these data, cholesterol count is <em>not</em> a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a <em>unique</em> value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a person’s cholesterol count.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Functions Defined by Equations</title>
<p><xref ref="example-falling-book" text="type-global"/> illustrates a function defined by an equation.</p>
<example xml:id="example-falling-book">
    <p>As of 2016,  One World Trade Center in New York City is the nation’s tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after <m>t</m> seconds is given by the equation <me>h = 1776 - 16t^2</me> Thus, after <m>\alert{1}</m> second the book’s height is <me>h = 1776 - 16(\alert{1})^2 = 1760 \text{ feet}</me> After <m>\alert{2}</m> seconds its height is <me>h = 1776 - 16(\alert{2})^2 = 1712 \text{ feet}</me> For this function, <m>t</m> is the input variable and <m>h</m> is the output variable. For any value of <m>t</m>, a unique value of <m>h</m> can be determined from the equation for <m>h</m>. We say that <m>h</m> <em>is a function of</em> <m>t</m>.</p>
 </example>  


</subsection>



<subsection><title>Function Notation</title>
    <p>There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, or <m>h</m> (or <m>F</m>, <m>G</m>, or <m>H</m>), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are
        the most common choices.) For instance, the height, <m>h</m>, of a falling textbook is a function of the elapsed time, <m>t</m>. We might call this function <m>f</m>. In other words, <m>f</m> is the name of the relationship between the variables <m>h</m> and <m>t</m>. We write
        <me>h = f (t)</me>
        which means "<m>h</m> is a function of <m>t</m>, and <m>f</m> is the name of the function."</p>
    
    <warning>
        <p>The new symbol <m>f(t)</m>, read "<m>f</m> of <m>t</m>," is another name for the height, <m>h</m>. The parentheses in the symbol <m>f(t)</m> do not indicate multiplication. (It would not make sense to multiply the name of a function by a variable.) Think of the symbol <m>f(t)</m> as a single variable that represents
            the output value of the function.</p>
    </warning>
    
    <p>With this new notation we may write
        <me>h = f (t) = 1776 - 16t^2</me>
        or just
        <me>f (t) = 1776 - 16t^2</me>
        instead of
        <me>h = 1776 - 16t^2</me>
        to describe the function.</p>
    
    <p>Perhaps it seems complicated to introduce a new symbol for <m>h</m>, but the notation <m>f(t)</m> is very useful for showing the correspondence between specific values of the variables <m>h</m> and <m>t</m>.
    </p>
    
    <example xml:id="example-falling-book-2">
        <p>In <xref ref="example-falling-book" text="type-global"/>, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation
            <me>h = 1776 - 16t^2</me>

        <p>which we read as "<m>f</m> of 1 equals 1760" and "<m>f</m> of 2 equals 1712." The values for the input variable, <m>t</m>, appear <em>inside</em> the parentheses, and the values for the output variable, <m>h</m>, appear on the other side of the equation.</p>
    </example>
    
    
    <p>Remember that when we write <m>y = f(x)</m>, the symbol <m>f(x)</m> is just another name for the output variable.</p>

    </p>
</assemblage>


    Many phenomena can be modeled using linear functions <m>y = f (x)</m> where the equations have the form
    <me>f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x.</me>
    The initial value, or the value of <m>f(0)</m>, is the vertical intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. 
    
    Thus, we can write an equation of a line as
    <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
    where the constant term, <m>b</m>, is the vertical intercept of the line, and <m>m</m>, the coefficient of <m>x</m>, is the slope of the line. This form for an equation of a line is called the <term>slope-intercept form</term><idx>slope-intercept form</idx>.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>
        If we write an equation of a linear function in the form,
        <me>f (x) = b + mx</me>
        then <m>m</m> is the <term>slope</term><idx>slope</idx> of the line, and <m>b</m> is the <term>vertical intercept</term>.
    </p>
</assemblage>

<p>(You may have encountered the slope-intercept equation in the equivalent form <m>y = mx + b</m>.)</p>
<p> For example, consider the two linear functions and their graphs shown in <xref ref="fig-decreasing-line" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="fig-increasing-line" text="type-global"/>.

<p>
    Some observations:
    <ul>
        <li>We can see that the vertical intercept of each line is given by the constant term, <m>b</m>. </li>
        <li>By examining the table of values, we can also see why the coefficient of <m>x</m>gives the slope of the line:</li> 
    <li>For <m>f (x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> decreases by <m>3</m> units.</li>
    <li> For <m>g(x)</m>, each time <m>x</m> increases by <m>1</m> unit, <m>y</m> increases by <m>2</m> units.</li>
</ul>

     For each graph, the coefficient of <m>x</m> is a scale factor that tells us how many units <m>y</m> changes for <m>1</m> unit increase in <m>x</m>. But that is exactly what the slope tells us about a line.
</p>

<p>
Is is also useful to introduce the term <m>x</m>-intercept at this point.
    <assemblage><title><m>x</m>-intercept</title>
    <p>
        An <term><m>x</m>-intercept</term> for a function <m>f(x)</m> is the value of <m>x</m> such that <m>f(x)=0</m>.

<example xml:id="example-internet-providers"><statement>
    <p>Francine is choosing an Internet service provider. She paid <dollar />30 for a modem, and she is considering three companies for service:
    <ul>
    <li> Juno charges <dollar />14.95 per month,</li>
    <li> ISP.com charges <dollar/>12.95 per month,</li> 
    <li> and peoplepc charges <dollar />15.95 per month.</li> 
</ul>Match the graphs in <xref ref="fig-internet-providers" text="type-global"/> to Francine’s Internet cost with each company.</p></statement>
    <solution>
        <p>Francine pays the same initial amount, <dollar />30 for the modem, under each plan. The monthly fee is the rate of change of her total cost, in dollars per month. We can write a formula for her cost under each plan. </p>
    <sidebyside widths="50% 40%"><p>
    <me>\text{Juno:   } f(x) = 30 + 14.95x</me>
    <me>\text{ISP.com:   } g(x) = 30 + 12.95x</me>
    <me>\text{peoplepc:   } h(x) = 30 + 15.95x</me>
    The graphs of these three functions all have the same <m>y</m>-intercept, but their slopes are determined by the monthly fees. The steepest graph, III, is the one with the largest monthly fee, peoplepc, and ISP.com, which has the lowest monthly fee, has the least steep graph, I.</p>

<note><p>
    In the equation <m>f (x) = b + mx</m>, we call <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> <term>parameters</term><idx>parameters</idx>. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation <m>y = 2x + 3</m>, <m>m = 2</m> and <m>b = 3</m>, and the variables are <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. By changing the values of <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>, we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line (see <xref ref="fig-slope-vs-intercept" text="type-global"/>). The collection of all linear functions <m>f (x) = b + mx</m> is called a <term>two-parameter</term><idx>two-parameter</idx> family of functions.

<subsection><title>Describing Functions</title>
<p>There are several terms that will be useful in describing functions.  We first begin with the notion of an increasing function.</p>

<assemblage><title>Increasing Function</title><p>A function $f$ is increasing if the values of $f(x)$ increase as $x$ increases.

The graph of an increasing function climbs as we move from left to right.</p>
</assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Decreasing Function</title>
<p>A function <m>f</m> is decreasing if the values of <m>f(x)</m> decrease as <m>x</m> increases.

The graph of a decreasing function falls as we move from left to right.</p>

</assemblage>
<p>
<em>A function <m>f(x)</m> is monotonic if it increases for all <m>x</m> or decreases for all <m>x</m>. 
</em>
</p>

<assemblage><title>Directly Proportional</title> <p>We say <m>y</m> is directly proportional to <m>x</m> if there is a nonzero constant <m>k</m> such that, <m>y = kx</m>. This <m>k</m> is called the constant of proportionality.
</p>
</assemblage>

<assemblage><title>Inversely Proportional</title> <p>We say that <m>y</m> is inversely proportional to <m>x</m> if <m>y</m> is proportional to the reciprocal of <m>x</m>, that is, <m>y = k/x</m> for a nonzero constant <m>k</m>.
