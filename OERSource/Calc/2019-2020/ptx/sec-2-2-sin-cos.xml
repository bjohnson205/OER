      Throughout <xref ref="C-2">Chapter</xref>,

      In <xref ref="sec-2-1-elem-rules">Section</xref>,
      we stated the rule for power functions,

        \text{if}~ f(x) = x^n,~ \text{then}~ f'(x) = nx^{n-1}

        \text{then}~ f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)

      Later in this section,
      we will use a graphical argument to conjecture derivative formulas for the sine and cosine functions.

      Looking at the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>x=-2</m>, we see that on the interval
      <m>-3\le x\le 2</m> the line rises by a little less than <m>1</m> unit. This gives 
      us a slope of approximately <m>0.8/5</m> or <m>0.9/5</m>, so we'll average those and
      say the slope of the tangent line to <m>y=g(x)</m> at <m>x=-2</m> is approximately
      <m>0.17</m>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      Looking at the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>x=-1</m>, we see that on the interval
      <m>-1\le x\le 2</m> the line rises by about <m>1</m> unit. This gives us a slope 
      of approximately <m>1/3\approx0.33</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Looking at the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>x=0</m>, we see that the line rises 
      by <m>2</m> units over the approximate interval <m>0\le x\le2.8</m>, giving us a 
      slope of about <m>2/2.8\approx0.71</m> for this line.
      </li>
      <li>
      Looking at the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>x=1</m>, we see that the line rises 
      by just over <m>4</m> units on the interval <m>0\le x\le 3</m>. This tells us the
      slope should be just over <m>4/3</m>, possibly around <m>1.4</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Looking at the tangent line to <m>g</m> at <m>x=2</m>, we see that the line rises
      by <m>4</m> units on about the interval <m>0.5\le x\le 2</m>, so the slope of this
      line is approximately <m>4/1.5\approx2.67</m>.

      </ul>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    The limit definition of <m>g'(0)</m> says 
    <me>g'(0)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(0+h)-g(0)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2^h-2^0}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2^h-1}{h}</me>.
    We consider this difference quotient at the values <m>h=0.1</m>, <m>h=0.01</m>, and 
    <m>h=0.001</m> and find that 
    <md>
    <mrow>\frac{2^{0.1}-1}{0.1}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.7177</mrow>,
    <mrow>\frac{2^{0.01}-1}{0.01}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.6956</mrow>,
    <mrow>\frac{2^{0.001}-1}{0.001}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.6933</mrow>
    </md>.
    Hence we approximate <m>g'(0)</m> by <m>0.693</m>, which is very close to our slope 
    estimate of <m>0.71</m> from (b) for the tangent line to <m>y=g(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    We start with the <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>g'</m> that we found in part (c): the point <m>(0,0.693)</m>.
    Then, since the slope of the tangent line to <m>g</m> at a point <m>x=a</m> is exactly 
    the value of <m>g'(a)</m>, we use our slope estimates from (b) to add more points to
    our graph:
    <me>(-2,0.17),~ (-1,0.33),~ (1,1.4),~ (2,2.67)</me>.
    Finally, since the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m> is always increasing and concave up, we know 
    the graph of <m>y=g'(x)</m> will be always positive and increasing. Thus we end up with
    the sketch shown below.

    <li>
    <p>
    Multiplying a function <m>g</m> by a positive constant <m>c</m> affects the graph of 
    <m>y=g(x)</m> by vertically stretching it if <m>1\lt c</m>, or by vertically compressing
    it if <m>0\lt c\lt 1</m>. The shapes of the graphs of <m>y=g(x)</m> and <m>y=g'(x)</m>
    are very similar, and it looks like the derivative graph is a slightly flattened 
    version of the graph of <m>y=g(x)</m>. This suggests <m>g'(x)=c\cdot g(x)</m> for some 
    constant <m>c</m> between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.
    In particular, we note that <m>\ln(2)\approx0.693</m>. Since this is the approximation 
    we found for <m>g'(0)</m>, where <m>g(0)=1</m>, it is reasonable to assume that a 
    formula for <m>g'</m> is <m>g'(x)=\ln(2)\cdot g(x)=2^x\ln(2)</m>.

    <title>The sine and cosine functions</title>
    <p permid="jJn">
      The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics.
      Sometimes called the <em>circular</em>
      functions due to their definition on the unit circle,
      these periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as tidal elevations,
      the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring,
      or the location of a point on a bicycle tire.
      Like polynomial and exponential functions,
      the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions,
      ones that are often used in building more complicated functions.
      As such, we would like to know formulas for
      <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]</m> and <m>\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]</m>,
      and the next two activities lead us to that end.

              January 1, 2012 corresponds to the instant <m>t = 2</m>,
              so we compute <m>V'(2)</m>.
              First, we observe by the sum and constant multiple rules that <m>V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)</m>.

              Since <m>V</m> is measured in thousands of dollars and <m>t</m> in years,

              the portfolio's value is decreasing at a decreasing rate.
              More specifically,
