<introduction permid="BlB">
    <p permid="TYZ">
      In previous chapters,
      we have seen that a function's derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing.
      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function's rate of change.
      For instance,
      an object's velocity tells us the rate of change of that object's position.
      By integrating the velocity over a time interval,
      we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval.
      If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval,
      we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.
    </p>

    <p permid="Agi">
      In this chapter, we introduce the concept of
      <em>differential equations</em>.
      A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative,
      which means that it tells us the function's rate of change.
      Using this information,
      we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself.
      Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function.
      As we'll see, this may be too much to ask in some situations,
      but we will still be able to make accurate approximations.

    <p permid="gnr">
      A differential equation is an equation that describes the derivative,
      or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us.
      For instance, the equation
      <me permid="cns">
        \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\sin(x^2)
      </me>
      describes the derivative of a
      function <m>y(x)</m> that is unknown to us.
    </p>
    
    
        <p permid="MuA">
      As many important examples of differential equations involve quantities
      that change in time, the independent variable in our discussion will
      frequently be time
      <m>t</m>.
      For example, the
      differential equation
      <me permid="IuB">
        \frac{ds}{dt} = 4t + 1
      </me>
      describes an objects position (<m>s(t)</m>) as a function of time.
    </p>
    
        <p permid="sBJ">
      If we know the velocity and the starting position of a moving object,
      we will be able to find its position at any later time.
    </p>
    
        <p permid="YIS">
      Because differential equations describe the derivative of a function,
      they give us information about how that function changes.
      Our goal will be to use this information to predict the value of the function in the future;
      in this way,
      differential equations provide us with something like a crystal ball.

<example xml:id="PA-7-1" permid="Mow">
  <statement>
  <p permid="ghn">
    The position of a moving object is given by the
    function <m>s(t)</m>,
    where <m>s</m> is measured in feet and <m>t</m> in seconds.
    We
    determine that the velocity is <m>v(t) = 4t + 1</m> feet per second.

          How much does the position change over the time interval <m>[0,4]</m>?

      <li permid="esa">
        <p permid="vql">
          Does this give you enough information to determine <m>s(4)</m>,
          the position at time <m>t=4</m>?
          If so, what is <m>s(4)</m>?
          If not,
          what additional information would you need to know to determine <m>s(4)</m>?

          Suppose you are told that the object's initial position <m>s(0) = 7</m>.

      </li>

      <li permid="WNB">
        <p permid="nLM">
          If we only know the velocity <m>v(t)=4t+1</m>,

  What does the quantity <m>\int_0^4 (4t+1)dt</m> represent in this problem?</p>

  <solution>
  <ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval <m>[0,4]</m>.  That is
  <me>\int_0^4 (4t+1)dt=left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^4=36</me>.  Therefore, the position changes by 36 feet over the interval <m>[0,4]</m>.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>
  Simply knowing how much the position has changed on the interval <m>[0,4]</m> does not tell us where the object is.  In order to know where the object is located we must also know where the object started.
  </p>
  </li>
  
    <li>
  <p>
  We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.  That is
  <me>\int_0^2 (4t+1)dt=left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^2=10</me>.  Therefore, the position changes by 10 feet over the interval <m>[0,2]</m>.
