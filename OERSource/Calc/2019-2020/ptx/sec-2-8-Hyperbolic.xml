  <introduction permid="VFV">
  <p>There is an important class of functions that show up in many real-life situations, the so-called hyperbolic functions.  
  Hyperbolic functions can be used to describe the shape of electrical lines freely hanging between two poles or any idealized hanging chain or cable supported only at its ends and hanging under its own weight.
  Hyperbolic functions can also be used to describe the path of a spacecraft performing a "gravitational slingshot" maneuver.

<subsection><title>The Hyperbolic Trigonometric Functions</title>
<p>
There are two "fundamental" hyperbolic trigonometric functions, the hyperbolic sine (<m>\sinh</m>) and hyperbolic cosine (<m>\cosh</m>).  These functions are defined in terms of the functions <m>e^x</m> and <m>e^{-x}</m>.
</p>

<assemblage><title>Hyperbolic Functions</title>
<p>
<me>
\sinh(x)=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2} \hskip 1cm \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}
</me>
</p>
</assemblage>

      <figure xml:id="hyperbolic-images">
      <caption>Graphs of <m>e^x</m>, <m>e^{-x}</m> together with <m>\sinh(x)</m> and <m>\cosh(x)</m>.</caption>

      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

<example>
<p>A cable hanging between two supports will form the shape of
a hyperbolic cosine. In particular, the formula

<me>
 y = \frac{T}{w}\cosh\left(\frac{wx}{T}\right)
</me>
where <m>T</m> is the tension at its lowest point, and <m>w</m> is the weight of the cable per unit length will will yield the total cable sag when evaluated at <m>x=0</m>.  
We can calculate the total sag in a powerline hanging between two poles spaced 400 feet apart where the mass per unit length is <m>50 lb/ft</m> and the tension at the lowest point is 2025 punds.  Specifically, the total sag is given by 

<me>
 y = \frac{2025lb}{50 lb/ft}\cosh\left(\frac{50\times 0}{2025}\right)=40.5 ft.
</me>
</p>


</example>

<p>In addition to the hyperbolic sine and cosine there is also a hyperbolic tangent function which is defined as you might expect.</p>
<assemblage><title>Hyperbolic Tangent</title>
<p>
<me>
\tanh(x)=\frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}
</me>
</p>
</assemblage>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>Identities and Properties</title>
<p>Similar to the usual trigonometric functions, the hyperbolic trigonometric functions have several important properties.  While we will not take the time to directly show these properties are valid, we do encourage the reader to confirm these properties by inspecting the graphs in <xref ref="hyperbolic-images">Figure</xref> above.
</p>
<assemblage><title>Properties of Hyperbolic Functions</title>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> <m>\cosh(0) = 1</m></li>
  <li> <m>\sinh(0) = 0</m></li>
  <li> <m>\cosh(-x) = \cosh(x)</m></li>
  <li> <m>\sinh(-x) = -\sinh(x)</m></li>
</ul>
</p>
</assemblage>
<p>
It is also useful to discuss the long-run behavior of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.  Again, inspection of <xref ref="hyperbolic-images">Figure</xref> above suggests that as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>, the graph of <m>\cosh(x)</m> resembles the graph of <m>\frac12e^x</m>.  Similarly, it appears that as <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m>, the graph of <m>\cosh(x)</m> resembles the graph of <m>\frac12e^{-x}</m>.  This behavior is further explained by using the formulas for <m>\cosh(x)</m> and <m>\sinh(x)</m> and the facts that <m>e^{-x}\rightarrow0</m> as <m>x\rightarrow\infty</m>, and <m>e^{x}\rightarrow0</m> as <m>x\rightarrow-\infty</m>

</p>




<p>
Recall that the trig functions were defined on the unit circle and hence were called the 
<em>circular functions</em>. This is where we get the Pythagorean identity, setting <m>x = \cos\theta</m> and <m>y=\sin\theta</m>
<me>
 \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1\text{ because }x^2+y^2 = 1
</me>

In fact, an analogous identity holds for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.

<assemblage><title></title>
<p>
 <me>
  \cosh^2\theta - \sinh^2{\theta} = 1
 </me>
 </p>
</assemblage>
This identity shows us how the hyperbolic functions got their name.  Suppose <m>(x,y)</m> is a point in the plane, and <m>x = \cosh\theta</m> and <m>y=\sinh\theta</m> for some <m>\theta</m>.  Then the point <m>(x,y)</m> lies on the hyperbola <m>x^2-y^2 = 1</m>.
</p>

<subsection><title>Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions</title>

We now proceed to calculate the derivatives of each of the hyperbolic functions.

Recall that <m>\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x</m>, <m>
\sinh(x)=\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}</m>, <m> \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2},
</m>, and <m>

<me>
\frac{d}{dx}\sinh(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}\right)=\left(\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}\right)=\cos(x)
</me>
<me>
\frac{d}{dx}\tanh(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}\right)=\left(\frac{(\cosh(x)^2-(\sinh(x)^2}{(\cosh(x))^2}\right)=\frac{1}{\cosh^2(x)}
</me>

<subsection><title>Applications of Hyperbolic Trigonometry</title>
<p>In Lincoln Nebraska there is a suspension bridge that spans from the Haymarket area to the baseball stadium on the other side of the railway lines.  The center part of the bridge is a suspension bridge, using two
concrete pillars 280 feet apart and 80 feet high.
The cable is be exactly 30 feet above the railway tracks in the
middle of the bridge, i.e., it sags exactly 50 feet.</p>

<p>
Gottfried Leibniz and Christian Huygens in 1691 determined that any cable hanging
under the force of gravity must have the shape of the graph of
<me> y(x) = a \cosh\left( \frac x a \right) + b. </me>
This shape is known as a <em>catenary</em>.
The parameter <m>a</m> is the ratio of cable tension to cable density.  The only use of the parameter <m>b</m> is to provide a vertical shift, if needed.
</p>
<p> We can ask two important questions.  First, what values must <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> have in order for the catenary to fit the
constraints provided by the placement of the concrete pillars and the low
point of the cable?
</p>

<p>In order to find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> we need to solve two separate equations.  We know that <m>y(0)=30</m> to ensure we have sufficient clearance above the railway tracks.
We also know that <m>y(140)=80</m> since the cable attaches to a 80 foot tall pillar 140 feet from the lowest point (center).  Therefore we have,
<me>
30=a \cosh\left( \frac 0 a \right) + b
</me>
<me>
80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) + b
</me>
Since <m>\cosh(0)=1</m> we can simplify the first equation to <m>30=a+b</m> substituting this equation into the second equation yields <m>80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) +30-a</m>.  Now, by graphing the <m>y=x \cosh\left( \frac{140}{x} \right) +30-x</m> and the line <m>y=80</m> and then graphically searching for the point of intersection (as in <xref ref="solvinghyper">Figure</xref>) we see that <m>80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) +30-a</m> when <m>a \approx 203.82</m>.
</p>

<figure xml:id="solvinghyper">
    <caption>Solving <m>80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) +30-a</m></caption>
    <interactive geogebra="pcj3yebb" height="600" width="600" />
</figure>

<p>Using the value of <m>a \approx 203.82</m> together with <m>30=a+b</m> we have <m>b=-173.82</m>.
Therefore, the height of the bridge can be modeled by the equation <me>h(x)=203.82 \cosh(\frac{x}{203.82}) - 173.82</me>
