<p>Terms in an algebraic expression are separated by addition operators and factors are separated by multiplication operators. The numerical factor of a term is called the <dfn class="terminology">coefficient</dfn>. For example, the algebraic expression \(x^2y^2+6xy-3\) can be thought of as \(x^2y^2+6xy+(-3)\) and has three terms. The first term, \(x^2y^2\text{,}\) represents the quantity \(1x^2y^2=1\cdot x\cdot x\cdot y\cdot y\) where \(1\) is the coefficient and \(x\) and \(y\) are the variables. All of the variable factors with their exponents form the variable part of a term. If a term is written without a variable factor, then it is called a constant term. Below we see the components of \(x^2y^2+6xy-3\text{.}\)</p>
