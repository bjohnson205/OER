<p>In the solution for the last example, it is important that we first divided each side by the coefficient of the exponential (in this last example this coefficient was \(10 \)) before applying the logarithm. If we didn't do this then, more often than not, we will make a calculation mistake.</p>
<p>This is due to the behavior of logarithms with multiplication. In particular,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\log(10(1.75)^t)=\log(10)+\log((1.75)^t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Often this property of logarithms is forgotten, and thus leads to mistakes. Even if we remember to apply this property, this leads to much more work than is necessary.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-33.html#warning-14">in-context</a></span>
