<p>Let \(f\) be the number of five dollar bills. Because Michael has 14 bills in his wallet, and all are either fives or tens, he must have \(14-3=11\) fives in his wallet.</p>
<p>Since a $\(5\) bill is worth \(5\) dollars, \(5f\) will give us the money amount of all the $\(5\) bills. The portion of the sentence which tells us that Michael has 3 $\(10\) bills tells us that the total amount of money in Michael's wallet is \(5*f+3*10=5f+30\) where \(f\) represents the number of $\(5\) in Michael's wallet. Since we have set up an linear equation, we can plug in the number of $\(5\) bills, 11:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
5*11+30=85 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Michael has nine $\(85\) in his wallet.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="Applications-Linear-Equations.html#solution-39">in-context</a></span>
