<p>We can also relate this concept to the graph of tangent. At an angle of 0, the line would be horizontal with a slope of zero. This corresponds to the value of \(\tan(0)=0\text{,}\) or where the graph of tangent passes through the origin. As the angle increases towards \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the slope of the line increases more and more. At an angle of \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the line would be vertical and the slope would be undefined. Immediately past \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the line would have a steep negative slope, corresponding to a large negative value of tangent. The undefined slope at \(\pi/2\) corresponds to a vertical asymptote on the graph, where the tangent value jumps from a large positive value to a large negative value.</p>
