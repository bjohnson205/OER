<body><span class="solution"><p>We first need to recognize that we have two linear equations \(y=0.25x+15\) and \(y=0.15x+25\text{.}\)  If we plug one mile into both equations we can see that Quick Rentals is much cheaper if you are only driving a mile.  In order to find where Handy Trucks is cheaper it makes sense to try finding the point where both companies cost the same amount.  In order to do this we find the intersection between the two lines.</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{gather}
0.25x+15=0.15+25\tag{1}\\
0.10x=10\tag{2}\\
x=100\tag{3}
\end{gather}
</div>
<p>Therefore, as long as you are driving more than 100 miles, (\(x &gt;100\)) we know that Handy Trucks is the better deal.</p></span></body>
