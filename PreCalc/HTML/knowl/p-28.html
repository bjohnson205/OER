<p>Finding equivalent fractions where the numerator and denominator are relatively prime, or have no common factor other than \(1\text{,}\) is called <dfn class="terminology">reducing to lowest terms</dfn>. This can be done by dividing the numerator and denominator by the <dfn class="terminology">greatest common factor (GCF)</dfn>. The GCF is the largest number that divides a set of numbers evenly. One way to find the GCF of 50 and 100 is to list all the factors of each and identify the largest number that appears in both lists. Remember, each number is also a factor of itself.</p>
