<body><span class="solution"><p>To solve this equation, we need to identify all angles, \(\theta\text{,}\) that have a tangent value of 1. In <a href="inverse-trig-functions.html" class="xref" alt="Section  Inverse Trigonometric Functions" title="Section  Inverse Trigonometric Functions">SectionÂ </a>, we found two solutions to the equation \(\tan(\theta)=1\text{,}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\theta=\frac{\pi}{4} \hspace{.25in} \text{and} \hspace{.25in} \theta=\frac{5\pi}{4}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>These solutions are two common angles on the unit circle that have a tangent value of \(1\text{.}\) However, if we look at the graph of \(f(\theta)=\tan(\theta)\) to see where it intersects with the horizontal line \(y=1\text{,}\) we can see that there are an infinite number of solutions to the equation \(\tan(\theta)=1\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img width="100%" src="imagesChap14/tan1Example1.png" alt="graph of tan(t)=1"></div></div></div>
<p>Notice that the two solutions we found above are \(\pi\) radians apart from one another. Because tangent is a periodic function with a period of \(\pi\text{,}\) we only need to choose one of these solutions as our initial solution. We can then use this initial solution to solve for all other solutions by adding and subtracting multiples of \(\pi\) from it. Note that it does not matter which solution we pick as our initial solution.</p>
<p>Using \(\pi/4\) as our initial solution and adding multiples of the period of tangent to this solution gives us the full set of solutions:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}+\pi k \hspace{.25in} \text{ where } k \text{ is any integer} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We can relate this solution set back to the intersection points on the graph above. When \(k=0\text{,}\) we get our initial solution of \(\pi/4\text{.}\) When \(k=1\text{,}\) we move to the right and get the next solution on the graph:  \(5\pi/4\text{.}\) When \(k=-1\text{,}\) we get the solution to the left of our initial solution:  \(-3\pi/4\text{,}\) and so on.</p></span></body>
