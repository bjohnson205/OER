<p>To eliminate the terms involving \(x\text{,}\) we would multiply both sides of the first equation by 5 and both sides of the second equation by \(âˆ’2\text{.}\) This results in an equivalent system where the variable \(x\) is eliminated when we add the equations together. Of course, there are other combinations of numbers that achieve the same result. We could even choose to eliminate the variable \(y\text{.}\) No matter which variable is eliminated first, the solution will be the same. Note that the substitution method, in this case, would require tedious calculations with fractional coefficients. One weakness of the elimination method, as we will see later in our study of algebra, is that it does not always work for nonlinear systems.</p>
