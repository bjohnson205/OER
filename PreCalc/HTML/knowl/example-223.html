<p>An apartment complex needs to relocate its residents due to water damage after a large storm. All the residents belongings are being packed into moving boxes of the same size. A moving company has been hired to relocate the individuals in the apartment building to their new location. The company has found that, on average, if they are relocating \(x \) people then they will need \(B(x) \) boxes. The company can only fit \(150 \) boxes into one of their trucks. Write a function which tells the company how many trucks they will need to move \(x \) people.</p>
