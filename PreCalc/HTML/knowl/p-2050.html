<p>Furthermore, a combatability issue that we need to think about with all combinations of functions is with their domain and range. For, in each combination, we are assuming that the two functions have the same domain. So, if we are plugging in an amount in dollars to \(f(x)\) and plugging in a type of vegetable to \(g(x)\) it would not make sense to combine these two functions. Similarly, if the output of \(f\) is a type of fruit and the output of \(g\) is a year, then we cannot combine the functions as adding, dividing, or multiplying a fruit and a year doesn't make sense.</p>
