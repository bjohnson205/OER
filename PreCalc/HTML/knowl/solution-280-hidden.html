<body><span class="solution"><p>Let's start by drawing a picture of the situation and labeling the known information.</p>
<img width="100%" src="imagesChap13/TreeExample.png" alt="triangle with tree"><p>We can introduce a variable, \(h\text{,}\) to represent the height of the tree. The two sides of the triangle that are most important to us are the side opposite of the \(57^\circ\) angle, which is the height of the tree that we are looking for, and the adjacent side, which is given as a distance of 30 feet.</p>
<p>The trigonometric function that relates the side opposite of the angle and the side adjacent to the angle is the tangent function. Using this function, we can set up an equation and solve to find \(h\text{.}\)</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
\tan(57^\circ) \amp= \frac{h}{30} \amp\amp \text{Solving for } h\\
\\
h \amp= 30\tan(57^\circ) \amp\amp \text{Using a calculator}\\
\\
h \amp\approx 46.2 \text{ feet} 
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>The tree is approximately 46.2 feet tall.</p></span></body>
