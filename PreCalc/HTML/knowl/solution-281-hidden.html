<body><span class="solution"><p>One way we can think about the graph of tangent is to relate the tangent function to the slope of a line going through the origin and a point \((x,y)\) on the unit circle. Above, we defined tangent as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(x\) and \(y\) are the coordinates of a point on the unit circle corresponding to a given angle \(\theta\text{.}\) Now, notice that \(y/x\) corresponds to the slope of a line through the origin. Therefore, the tangent of an angle, \(\theta\text{,}\) is <dfn class="terminology">equal to</dfn> the slope of a line going through the origin making an angle of \(\theta\) with the positive \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p></p>
<img width="100%" src="imagesChap13/TangentSlope.png" alt="tangent on unit circle"><p>We can also relate this concept to the graph of tangent. At an angle of 0, the line would be horizontal with a slope of zero. This corresponds to the value of \(\tan(0)=0\text{,}\) or where the graph of tangent passes through the origin. As the angle increases towards \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the slope of the line increases more and more. At an angle of \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the line would be vertical and the slope would be undefined. Immediately past \(\pi/2\text{,}\) the line would have a steep negative slope, corresponding to a large negative value of tangent. The undefined slope at \(\pi/2\) corresponds to a vertical asymptote on the graph, where the tangent value jumps from a large positive value to a large negative value.</p></span></body>
