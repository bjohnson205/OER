<p>In the last section we developed a few important trigonometric identities and some examples.  In this section, we will continue working with a few special trigonometric identities and do some more examples. All of these examples can be derived from basic trigonometric principles.  However, in this book we will focus not on deriving the identities but rather in using the identities to solve problems.  For this reason we do not include derivations of the identities but instead refer you to other texts on trigonometry for such derivations.</p>
