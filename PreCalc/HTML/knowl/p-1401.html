<p>The range of the function is the set of all \(g (x)\)-values that appear on the graph. We can see in the graph that the highest point is \((5, 5)\text{,}\) so the largest \(g (x)\)-value is \(5\text{.}\) We can also see that the smallest \(g(x)\)-value is as close to (10,0) as we can get coming from above, but not quite reaching (10,0). Since we also have all \(g(x)\)-values between 0 and 10, the range of the function \(g\) is the interval \((0, 5]\text{.}\) Note that the parenthesis is to indicate that we do not quite reach 0 while the bracket on the 5 shows that we achieve the value 5.</p>
