<p>Sometimes a question may ask you to "prove the identity" or "establish the identity." This is the same idea as when you are asked to show that \((x-1)^2 = x^2-2x+1\text{.}\) In this type of question, we must show the algebraic manipulations that demonstrate that the left and right side of the equation are in fact equal. You can think of a "prove the identity" problem as a simplification problem where you <em class="emphasis">know the answer</em>: you know what the end goal of the simplification should be and you just need to show the steps to get there.</p>
