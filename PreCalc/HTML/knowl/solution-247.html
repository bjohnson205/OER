<p>As suggested above, let's begin by listing the units of the input and output of the functions given and the function we are to create. The function we are given, \(B(x)\text{,}\) has as its input a number of people and outputs the number of boxes needed.</p>
<p>The function we are to create needs an input of people and output of trucks needed, let's call this function \(T(x)\text{.}\) Since \(B(x) \) is the number of boxes, and each truck can hold 150 boxes, the number of trucks needed should be</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T(x)=\frac{B(x)}{150}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that this function makes sense as the input of \(B(x)\) is number of people which is also what we wanted our function \(T(x)\) to have as an input.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-43.html#solution-247">in-context</a></span>
