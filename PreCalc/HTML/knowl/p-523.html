<p>The solution to the system is \((3, 2)\text{.}\) Of course, the variable is not always so easily eliminated. Typically, we have to find an equivalent system by applying the multiplication property of equality to one or both of the equations as a means to line up one of the variables to eliminate. The goal is to arrange so that either the \(x\) terms or the \(y\) terms are additive opposites, so that when the equations are added, the terms eliminate each other.</p>
