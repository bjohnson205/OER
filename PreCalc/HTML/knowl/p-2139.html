<p>Do the graphs of all <dfn class="terminology">cubic</dfn>, or third-degree, polynomials have a basic shape in common? We can graph a few examples and find out. Unlike the basic parabola, the graph of \(y = x^3\) is always increasing. At the origin, however, it changes from concave down to concave up. A point where the graph changes concavity is called an <dfn class="terminology">inflection point</dfn>. You do not need to concern yourself with concavity and inflection points in this course. However, if you continue on to Calculus, this definition will appear again!</p>
