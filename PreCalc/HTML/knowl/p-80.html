<p>You may already be familiar with square roots. Every nonnegative number has two square roots, defined as follows:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
s ~\text{ is a square root of }~ n ~\text{ if }~s^2 = n.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For example, 4 is a square root of 16, because \(4^2=16\text{.}\) Since \((-4)^2=16\text{,}\) we can say that \(âˆ’4\) is a square root of 16 as well. We use the radical sign \(\sqrt{  }\) to denote the square root of a number. By convention, we will use the positive answer when calculating a square root. There are several other kinds of roots, one of which is called the <dfn class="terminology">cube root</dfn>, denoted by \(\sqrt[3]{n}\text{.}\) We define the cube root as follows.</p>
