<p>The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original <a class="url" href="https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu" target="_blank">Mathbook XML</a>, now known as PreTeXt. My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016, as well as the support of the ongoing <a class="url" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pretext-support" target="_blank">user group</a>. David Farmer's conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> source and converting it to PreTeXt; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy. Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help, and it is through Alex's fantastic work that live WeBWorK exercises are not only possible, but also included from the 2017 version forward. Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book's production editor; his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book, including the presence of answers to activities and non- WeBWorK exercises and other supporting material for instructors.</p>
