<p>Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5% every year. Let \(A(t)\) be the amount of money in the account in year \(t\text{.}\) </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is the rate of change of \(A\) with respect to \(t\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that you are also withdrawing $10,000 per year. Write a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch a slope field for this differential equation, find any equilibrium solutions, and identify them as either stable or unstable. Write a sentence or two that describes the significance of the stability of the equilibrium solution.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that you initially deposit $100,000 into the account. How long does it take for you to deplete the account?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the account?</p></li>
<li><p>If your initial deposit is $300,000, how much could you withdraw every year without depleting the account?</p></li>
