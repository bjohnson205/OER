<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Through the method of integration by parts, we can evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) and \(\int x \ln(x) \, dx\text{.}\) Using a substitution enables us to trade one of the functions in the product for its derivative, and the other for its antiderivative, in an effort to find a different product of functions that is easier to integrate.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the algebraic structure of an integrand is a product of basic functions in the form \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\text{,}\) we can use the substitution \(u = f(x)\) and \(dv = g'(x) \,dx\) and apply the rule</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>to evaluate the original integral \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\) by instead evaluating</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int v \, du = \int f'(x) g(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>When deciding to integrate by parts, we have to select both \(u\) and \(dv\text{.}\) That selection is guided by the overall principle that the new integral \(\int v \, du\) not be more difficult than the original integral \(\int u \, dv\text{.}\) In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as \(\ln(x)\)), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable \(u\text{.}\) In addition, \(dv\) must be a function that we can antidifferentiate.</p></li>
