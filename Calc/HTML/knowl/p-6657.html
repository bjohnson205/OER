<p>Suppose you receive \(\dollar5000\) through an inheritance. You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays \(8\%\) annually, compounded monthly. That means that each month your investment earns \(\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P\) additional dollars, where \(P\) is your principal balance at the start of the month. So in the first month your investment earns</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
5000 \left(\frac{0.08}{12}\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or \(\dollar33.33\text{.}\) If you reinvest this money, you will then have \(\dollar5033.33\) in your account at the end of the first month. From this point on, assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.</p>
