<p>First, we sketch a picture of the dam, as shown in <a knowl="./knowl/F-6-4-DamEx.html" knowl-id="xref-F-6-4-DamEx" alt="Figure 6.26 " title="Figure 6.26 ">FigureÂ 6.26</a>. Note that, as in problems involving the work to pump out a tank, we let the positive \(x\)-axis point down.</p>
<figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/6_4_DamEx.svg" width="73%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">6.26</span>A trapezoidal dam that is 25 feet tall, 60 feet wide at its base, 90 feet wide at its top, with the water line 5 feet down from the top of its face.</figcaption></figure><p>Pressure is constant at a fixed depth, so we consider a slice of water at constant depth on the face, as shown in the figure. The area of this slice is approximately the area of the rectangle pictured. Since the width of that rectangle depends on the variable \(x\text{,}\) we find a formula for the line that represents one side of the dam. It is straightforward to find that \(y = 45 - \frac{3}{5}x\text{.}\) Hence, the approximate area of a representative slice is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{slice} } = 2 f(x) \Delta x = 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>At any point on this slice, the depth is approximately constant, so the pressure can be considered constant. Because the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, the depth of any point on the representative slice is approximately \((x-5)\text{.}\) Now, since pressure is given by \(P = 62.4d\text{,}\) we have that at any point on the slice</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{slice} } = 62.4(x-5)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Knowing both the pressure and area, we can find the force the water exerts on the slice. Using \(F = PA\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice} } = P_{\text{slice} } \cdot A_{\text{slice} } = 62.4(x-5) \cdot 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Finally, we use a definite integral to sum the forces over the appropriate range of \(x\)-values. Since the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, we start at \(x = 5\) and take slices all the way to the bottom of the dam, where \(x = 30\text{.}\) Hence,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_{x=5}^{x=25} 62.4(x-5) \cdot 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find \(F = 848 640\) pounds.</p></span><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-6-4-physics.html#solution-260">in-context</a></span>
