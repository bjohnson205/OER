<p>As <a knowl="./knowl/PA-8-6.html" knowl-id="xref-PA-8-6" alt="Preview Activity 8.33 " title="Preview Activity 8.33 ">Preview ActivityÂ 8.33</a> shows, it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series, and then determine the coefficients from other information. In other words, we define a function as an infinite series of powers of \(x\) and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function. This method allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations, even if we cannot solve them explicitly. This is different from our work with Taylor series since we are not using an original function \(f\) to generate the coefficients of the series.</p>
