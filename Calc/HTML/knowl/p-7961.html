<p>A power series is a series of the form</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>

<li><p>We can often assume a solution to a given problem can be written as a power series, then use the information in the problem to determine the coefficients in the power series. This method allows us to approximate solutions to certain problems using partial sums of the power series; that is, we can find approximate solutions that are polynomials.</p></li>
<li><p>The connection between power series and Taylor series is that they are essentially the same thing: on its interval of convergence a power series is the Taylor series of its sum.</p></li>
