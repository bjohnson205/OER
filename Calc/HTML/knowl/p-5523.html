<li><p>Consider a rectangular dam that is 100 feet wide and 50 feet tall, and suppose that water presses against the dam all the way to the top.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a semicircular dam with a radius of 30 feet. Suppose that the water rises to within 10 feet of the top of the dam.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider a trough with triangular ends, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F-6-4-Act3Trough.html" knowl-id="xref-F-6-4-Act3Trough" alt="Figure 6.27 " title="Figure 6.27 ">FigureÂ 6.27</a>, where the tank is 10 feet long, the top is 5 feet wide, and the tank is 4 feet deep. Say that the trough is full to within 1 foot of the top with water of weight density 62.4 pounds/ft\(^3\text{.}\) How much force does the water exert against one of the triangular ends?</p></li>
