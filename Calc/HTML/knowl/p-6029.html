<p>Let \(y(t)\) be the number of thousands of mice that live on a farm; assume time \(t\) is measured in years.<span class="footnote"><a knowl="./knowl/fn-44-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-44" alt="Footnote 7.2 " title="Footnote 7.2 "><sup> 2 </sup></a></span></p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The population of the mice grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice. Express this as a differential equation.</p></li>
<li>
<p>At some point, the farmer brings \(C\) cats to the farm. The number of mice that the cats can eat in a year is</p>

</li>
<li><p>Sketch a graph of the function \(M(y)\) for a single cat \(C=1\) and explain its features by looking, for instance, at the behavior of \(M(y)\) when \(y\) is small and when \(y\) is large.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(C=1\text{.}\) Find the equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable. Use this to explain the long-term behavior of the mice population depending on the initial population of the mice.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(C=60\text{.}\) Find the equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable. Use this to explain the long-term behavior of the mice population depending on the initial population of the mice.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the smallest number of cats you would need to keep the mice population from growing arbitrarily large?</p></li>
