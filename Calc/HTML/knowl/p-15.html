<p>Moreover, this approach is consistent with the following goals: </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.</p></li>
<li><p>To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true. Often we do this through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.</p></li>
<li><p>To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, working on activities in small groups in class, and doing substantial exercises outside of class time.</p></li>
<li><p>To strengthen students' written and oral communicating skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of calculus.</p></li>
</ul>
