<p>When deciding to integrate by parts, we have to select both \(u\) and \(dv\text{.}\) That selection is guided by the overall principle that the new integral \(\int v \, du\) not be more difficult than the original integral \(\int u \, dv\text{.}\) In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as \(\ln(x)\)), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable \(u\text{.}\) In addition, \(dv\) must be a function that we can antidifferentiate.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-5-4-parts.html#li-3086">in-context</a></span>
