<p>For the town of Mathland, MI, residential power consumption has shown certain trends over recent years. Based on data reflecting average usage, engineers at the power company have modeled the town's rate of energy consumption by the function</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
r(t) = 4 + \sin(0.263t + 4.7) + \cos(0.526t+9.4)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here, \(t\) measures time in hours after midnight on a typical weekday, and \(r\) is the rate of consumption in megawatts<span class="footnote"><a knowl="./knowl/fn-32-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-32" alt="Footnote 5.5 " title="Footnote 5.5 "><sup> 5 </sup></a></span> at time \(t\text{.}\) Units are critical throughout this problem. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Sketch a carefully labeled graph of \(r(t)\) on the interval [0,24] and explain its meaning. Why is this a reasonable model of power consumption?</p></li>
<li><p>Without calculating its value, explain the meaning of \(\int_0^{24} r(t) \, dt\text{.}\) Include appropriate units on your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the exact amount of energy Mathland consumes in a typical day.</p></li>
<li><p>What is Mathland's average rate of power consumption in a given 24-hour period? What are the units on this quantity?</p></li>
