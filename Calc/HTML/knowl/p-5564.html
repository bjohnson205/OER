<p>First, we set up axes and a sketch for one of the ends of the cylindrical tank. It is simplest to let ground level correspond to the (horizontal) \(y\)-axis with the positive \(x\)-axis pointing straight down, so that \(x = 0\) corresponds to ground level and the value of \(x\) tells us the depth of a particular location. The circular end of the tank has radius \(3\) and is centered at the point \((5,0)\) since its top is \(2\) feet underground. Thus, the equation of that circle is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Solving for \(y\text{,}\) we find the equation of one half of the circle, the half that is pictured at right in the figure below: \(y = f(x) = \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2}\text{.}\)</p>
