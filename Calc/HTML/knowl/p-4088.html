<p>Thus, the First FTC can used in two ways. First, to find the difference \(F(b) - F(a)\) for an antiderivative \(F\) of the integrand \(f\text{,}\) even if we may not have a formula for \(F\) itself. To do this, we must know the value of the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly, perhaps through known geometric formulas for area. In addition, the First FTC provides a way to find the exact value of a definite integral, and hence a certain net signed area exactly, by finding an antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating its total change over the interval. In this case, we need to know a formula for the antiderivative \(F\text{.}\) Both of these perspectives are reflected in <a knowl="./knowl/F-5-2-Intro.html" knowl-id="xref-F-5-2-Intro" alt="Figure 5.10 " title="Figure 5.10 ">FigureÂ 5.10</a>.</p>
