<p>The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like “\(k\) million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of \(n\) billion of dollars.” Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals \(P\) dollars for each person.</p>
