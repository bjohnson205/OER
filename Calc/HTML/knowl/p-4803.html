<p>For a given function \(f\) and interval \([a,b]\text{,}\) \(E_{T,4} = \int_a^b f(x) \,dx - T_4\) calculates the difference between the exact value of the definite integral and the approximation generated by the Trapezoid Rule with \(n = 4\text{.}\) If we look at not only \(E_{T,4}\text{,}\) but also the other errors generated by using \(T_n\) and \(M_n\) with \(n = 4\) and \(n = 8\) in the two examples noted in <a knowl="./knowl/T-5-6-Ex2.html" knowl-id="xref-T-5-6-Ex2" alt="Table 5.29 " title="Table 5.29 ">TableÂ 5.29</a>, we see an evident pattern. Not only is the sign of the error (which measures whether the rule generates an over- or under-estimate) tied to the rule used and the function's concavity, but the magnitude of the errors generated by \(T_n\) and \(M_n\) seems closely connected. In particular, the errors generated by the Midpoint Rule seem to be about half the size of those generated by the Trapezoid Rule.</p>
