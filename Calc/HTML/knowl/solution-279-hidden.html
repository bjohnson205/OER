<p>A graph of \(f\) against \(P\) is given in blue in the figure below. This graph and the differential equation show that the equilibrium solutions occur when \(f(P)=0\text{,}\) or when \(P=0\) or \(P=6\text{.}\) Since \(P' \lt 0\) for \(P\) slightly less than 0, the solutions with \(P \lt 0\) decrease away from the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) Also, \(P'&gt;0\) for \(P\) slightly larger than 0 means that the solutions for \(P \gt \) increase away from the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) So \(P=0\) is an unstable equilibrium. If \(P\) is slightly less than \(6\) we see that \(P \gt 0\text{,}\) so these solutions increase toward the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) When \(P\) is slightly larger than \(6\text{,}\) we have \(P' \lt 0\) and so these solutions decrease toward the equilibrium \(P = 6\text{.}\) We conclude that the equilibrium solution \(P=6\) is stable.</p>

<li>
<p>Since \(P\) will decrease by \(1\) thousand fish every month through harvesting, the new differential equation is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = g(P) = P(6-P)-1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>A sketch of \(g\) against \(P\) is given in green in the figure in (a). The equilibrium solutions now occur when \(g(P) = P(6-P)-1 = 0\text{.}\) This happens when \(P^2-6P+1 = 0\text{.}\) The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to this quadratic equation are</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2} \approx 5.83 \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ P = \frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2} \approx 0.172\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The same argument as in (a) shows that the equilibrium at \(P\approx 0.172\) is unstable and the equilibrium at \(P \approx 5.83\) is stable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assuming that there are fish in the lake, so that \(P &gt; 0\text{,}\) there are two cases to consider. If \(P \lt \frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2}\text{,}\) then \(P' \lt 0\) and the fish population will die out. If \(\frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2} \lt P \lt \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\text{,}\) then \(P' \gt 0\) and the fish population will increase and approach a stable equilibrium population of \(\frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\) thousand fish. If \(P \gt \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\text{,}\) then \(P' \lt 0\) and the fish population will decrease and approach a stable equilibrium population of \(\frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\) thousand fish.</p></li>
<li>
<p>In this case the differential equation becomes</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = g(P) = P(6-P)-h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We will have equilibrium solutions when \(P^2 - 6P + h = 0\) or when</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{6+\sqrt{36-4h}}{2} \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ P = \frac{6-\sqrt{36-4h}}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>We need a positive stable equilibrium. This will will happen as long as \(36-4h \ge 0\) or when \(h \le 9\text{.}\) So the maximum harvest is \(9000\) fish. Note that \(P'\) is negative, so we need to start with more than \(3000\) fish. Since \(P(6-P)\) has a maximum value of \(9\text{,}\) the fish will reproduce quickly enough so that harvesting \(9000\) fish will maintain a stable population.</p></li>
