<p>Express the following statements as differential equations. In each case, you will need to introduce notation to describe the important quantities in the statement so be sure to clearly state what your notation means. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>The population of a town grows continuously at an annual rate of 1.25%.</p></li>
<li><p>A radioactive sample loses 5.6% of its mass every day.</p></li>
