<p>Suppose that the population of a species of fish is controlled by the logistic equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(10 - P)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(P\) is measured in thousands of fish and \(t\) is measured in years. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What is the carrying capacity of this population?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that a long time has passed and that the fish population is stable at the carrying capacity. At this time, humans begin harvesting 20% of the fish every year. Modify the differential equation by adding a term to incorporate the harvesting of fish.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the new carrying capacity?</p></li>
<li><p>What will the fish population be one year after the harvesting begins?</p></li>
<li><p>How long will it take for the population to be within 10% of the carrying capacity?</p></li>
