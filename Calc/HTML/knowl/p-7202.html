<p>We have now encountered several tests for determining convergence or divergence of series. </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>The Divergence Test can be used to show that a series diverges, but never to prove that a series converges.</li>
<li>We used the Integral Test to determine the convergence status of an entire class of series, the \(p\)-series.</li>
<li>The Limit Comparison Test works well for series that involve rational functions and which can therefore by compared to \(p\)-series.</li>
<li>Finally, the Ratio Test allows us to compare our series to a geometric series; it is particularly useful for series that involve \(n\)th powers and factorials.</li>
<li>Two other tests, the Direct Comparison Test and the Root Test, are discussed in the exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p> One of the challenges of determining whether a series converges or diverges is finding which test answers that question.</p>
