<p>We have learned two antidifferentiation techniques: \(u\)-substitution and integration by parts. The former is used to reverse the chain rule, while the latter to reverse the product rule. But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances. For example, while \(\int xe^{x^2} \, dx\) may be evaluated by \(u\)-substitution and \(\int x e^x \, dx\) by integration by parts, neither method provides a route to evaluate \(\int e^{x^2} \, dx\text{,}\) and in fact an elementary algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\) does not exist. No antidifferentiation method will provide us with a simple algebraic formula for a function \(F(x)\) that satisfies \(F'(x) = e^{x^2}\text{.}\)</p>
