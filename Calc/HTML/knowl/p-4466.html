<p>The general technique of integration by parts involves trading the problem of integrating the product of two functions for the problem of integrating the product of two related functions. That is, we convert the problem of evaluating \(\int u \, dv\) to that of evaluating \(\int v \, du\text{.}\) This clearly shapes our choice of \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\) In <a knowl="./knowl/Ex-5-4-IBP.html" knowl-id="xref-Ex-5-4-IBP" alt="Example 5.19 " title="Example 5.19 ">ExampleÂ 5.19</a>, the original integral to evaluate was \(\int x \cos(x) \,dx\text{,}\) and through the substitution provided by integration by parts, we were instead able to evaluate \(\int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\text{.}\) Note that the original function \(x\) was replaced by its derivative, while \(\cos(x)\) was replaced by its antiderivative.</p>
