<p>The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series: the \(p\)-series. However, we have seen that it is often difficult to integrate functions, so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time. In fact, even for a relatively simple series such as \(\sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}\text{,}\) the Integral Test is not an option. In what follows we develop a test that applies to series of rational functions by comparing their behavior to the behavior of \(p\)-series.</p>
