<p>The formula \(m = d \cdot V\) is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used in our work: for a body moving in a fixed direction, distance = rate \(\cdot\) time, and, for a rectangle, its area is given by \(A = l \cdot w\text{.}\) These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved, such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle, are <em class="emphasis">constant</em>. When these quantities are not constant, we have turned to the definite integral for assistance. By working with small slices on which the quantity of interest (such as velocity) is approximately constant, we can use a definite integral to add up the values on the pieces.</p>
