<li><p>A continuous function \(f\) has a limit \(L\) as the independent variable \(x\) goes to infinity if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we want by choosing \(x\) as large as we need.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect that a sequence \(\{s_n\}\) will have a limit \(L\) as \(n\) goes to infinity if we can make the entries \(s_n\) in the sequence as close to \(L\) as we want by choosing \(n\) as large as we need.</p></li>
<li><p>As \(n\) gets large, the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to \(n\) and so \(\frac{1+n}{2+n}\) looks like \(\frac{n}{n}\) or 1 for large \(n\text{.}\) So the sequence \(\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}\) has a limit of 1 at infinity.</p></li>
