<p>The examples we have considered in this section have all been for Taylor polynomials and series centered at 0, but Taylor polynomials and series can be centered at any value of \(a\text{.}\) We look at examples of such Taylor polynomials in this exercise.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Let \(f(x) = \sin(x)\text{.}\) Find the Taylor polynomials up through order four of \(f\) centered at \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{.}\) Then find the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) centered at \(x = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{.}\) Why should you have expected the result?</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(f(x) = \ln(x)\text{.}\) Find the Taylor polynomials up through order four of \(f\) centered at \(x = 1\text{.}\) Then find the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) centered at \(x = 1\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Use your result from (b) to determine which Taylor polynomial will approximate \(\ln(2)\) to two decimal places. Explain in detail how you know you have the desired accuracy.</p></li>
