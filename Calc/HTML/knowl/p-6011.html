<p>The population of a species of fish in a lake is \(P(t)\) where \(P\) is measured in thousands of fish and \(t\) is measured in months. The growth of the population is described by the differential equation</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = f(P) = P(6-P)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Sketch a graph of \(f(P) = P(6-P)\) and use it to determine the equilibrium solutions and whether they are stable or unstable. Write a complete sentence that describes the long-term behavior of the fish population.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose now that the owners of the lake allow fishers to remove 1000 fish from the lake every month (remember that \(P(t)\) is measured in <em class="emphasis">thousands</em> of fish). Modify the differential equation to take this into account. Sketch the new graph of \(dP/dt\) versus \(P\text{.}\) Determine the new equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the situation in part (b), give a description of the long-term behavior of the fish population.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that fishermen remove \(h\) thousand fish per month. How is the differential equation modified?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the largest number of fish that can be removed per month without eliminating the fish population? If fish are removed at this maximum rate, what is the eventual population of fish?</p></li>
