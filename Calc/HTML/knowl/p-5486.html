<p>Suppose that a sump crock has the shape of a frustum of a cone, as pictured in <a knowl="./knowl/F-6-4-Crock.html" knowl-id="xref-F-6-4-Crock" alt="Figure 6.23 " title="Figure 6.23 ">FigureÂ 6.23</a>. The crock has a diameter of 3 feet at its surface, a diameter of 1.5 feet at its base, and a depth of 4 feet. In addition, suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window. To accomplish this, the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock. How much work is required to empty the sump crock if it is initially completely full?</p>
