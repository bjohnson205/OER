<p>Observe that \(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\text{,}\) \(f''(x) = 6x - 4\text{,}\) and \(f'''(x) = 6\text{,}\) so \(f'(0) = 3\text{,}\) \(f''(0) = -4\text{,}\) and \(f'''(0) = 6\text{.}\) In addition, \(f(0) = -1\)  Thus, the 3rd order Taylor polynomial centered at \(a = 0\) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P_3(x) = -1 + 3x - \frac{4}{2!}x^2 + \frac{6}{3!}x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that this is the same polynomial as \(f(x)\text{,}\) which is not surprising since the degree 3 Taylor polynomial is the degree 3 polynomial that has the same value, slope, concavity, and third derivative at \(a = 0\) as the original.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since \(f^{(4)}(x) = 0\) for all \(x\text{,}\) \(f^{(4)}(0) = 0\text{,}\) and similarly every higher derivative of \(f\) will be zero. Thus, the the 4th, 12th, and 100th order Taylor polynomials (centered at \(a = 0\)) are all identical to \(P_3(x)\) found in (a). for \(f(x) = x^3-2x^2+3x-1\text{.}\) We should expect this because all of the higher derivatives (than the third) of the original function are identically zero.</p></li>
<li><p>For \(n = 1, 2, \ldots, m-1\text{,}\) the degree \(n\) Taylor polyomial of \(f\) will be given by the usual formula. But for every \(n \ge m\text{,}\) \(P_n(x) = f(x)\text{.}\) That is, all of the Taylor polynomials of degree at least that of the original function are simply the function itself.</p></li>
