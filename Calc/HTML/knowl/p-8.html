<p>Finally, I am grateful for all that my students have taught me over the years. Their responses and feedback have helped to shape me as a teacher, and I appreciate their willingness to wholeheartedly engage in the activities and approaches I've tried in class, to let me know how those affect their learning, and to help me learn and grow as an instructor. Early on, they provided useful editorial feedback on this text.</p>
