<p>In the exponential model we introduced in <a knowl="./knowl/act-7-6-1.html" knowl-id="xref-act-7-6-1" alt="Activity 7.19 " title="Activity 7.19 ">ActivityÂ 7.19</a>, the per capita growth rate is constant. This means that when the population is large, the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population is small. It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should decrease when the population becomes large, since there will not be enough resources to support so many people. We expect it would be a more realistic model to assume that the per capita growth rate depends on the population \(P\text{.}\)</p>
