<p>Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers? That doing so is possible in some situations shouldn't come as a surprise. The definite integral is the sum of an infinite collections of numbers, and we have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section. As we investigate other infinite sums, there are two key questions we seek to answer: (1) is the sum finite? and (2) if yes, what is its value?</p>
