<p>Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate at which an object, such as a cup of coffee, cools is proportional to the difference in the object's temperature and room temperature. If \(T(t)\) is the object's temperature and \(T_r\) is room temperature, this law is expressed at</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-T_r)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality. In this problem, temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and time in minutes. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Two calculus students, Alice and Bob, enter a 70\(^\circ\) classroom at the same time. Each has a cup of coffee that is 100\(^\circ\text{.}\) The differential equation for Alice has a constant of proportionality \(k=0.5\text{,}\) while the constant of proportionality for Bob is \(k=0.1\text{.}\) What is the initial rate of change for Alice's coffee? What is the initial rate of change for Bob's coffee?</p></li>
<li><p>What feature of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee could explain this difference?</p></li>
<li>
<p>As the heating unit turns on and off in the room, the temperature in the room is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
T_r=70+10\sin t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Implement Euler's method with a step size of \(\Delta t = 0.1\) to approximate the temperature of Alice's coffee over the time interval \(0\leq t\leq
50\text{.}\) This will most easily be performed using a spreadsheet such as <em class="emphasis">Excel</em>. Graph the temperature of her coffee and room temperature over this interval.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the same way, implement Euler's method to approximate the temperature of Bob's coffee over the same time interval. Graph the temperature of his coffee and room temperature over the interval.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the similarities and differences that you see in the behavior of Alice's and Bob's cups of coffee.</p></li>
