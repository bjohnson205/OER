<p>Consider the curve given by \(y = f(x) = 2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)}\text{.}\) </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Plot this curve in the window \(x = 0 \ldots 30\text{,}\) \(y = 0 \ldots 3\) (with constrained scaling so the units on the \(x\) and \(y\) axis are equal), and use it to generate a solid of revolution about the \(x\)-axis. Explain why this curve could generate a reasonable model of a baseball bat.</p></li>
<li><p>Let \(x\) and \(y\) be measured in inches. Find the total volume of the baseball bat generated by revolving the given curve about the \(x\)-axis. Include units on your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that the baseball bat has constant weight density, and that the weight density is \(0.6\) ounces per cubic inch. Find the total weight of the bat whose volume you found in (b).</p></li>
<li><p>Because the baseball bat does not have constant cross-sectional area, we see that the amount of weight concentrated at a location \(x\) along the bat is determined by the volume of a slice at location \(x\text{.}\) Explain why we can think about the function \(\rho(x) = 0.6 \pi f(x)^2\) (where \(f\) is the function given at the start of the problem) as being the weight density function for how the weight of the baseball bat is distributed from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 30\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the center of mass of the baseball bat.</p></li>
