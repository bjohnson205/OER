<p>Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment \(M\) that will take our outstanding principal to \(0\) in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of \(M\) that makes \(P(t) = 0\) in formulaÂ <a knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq-loan2" alt="Equation 8.9 " title="Equation 8.9 ">(8.9)</a>. If we set \(P(t) = 0\) and solve for \(M\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>

<li><p>Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?</p></li>
