<p>From physics, <em class="emphasis">Hooke's Law</em>  for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length. That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring \(x\) units from its natural length is \(F(x) = kx\) for some constant \(k\) (which is called the <em class="emphasis">spring constant</em>.) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet. Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.</p>
