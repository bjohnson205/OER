<p>Suppose that you have a water tank that holds 100 gallons of water. A briny solution, which contains 20 grams of salt per gallon, enters the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute.</p>
<p>At the same time, the solution is well mixed, and water is pumped out of the tank at the rate of 3 gallons per minute. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Since 3 gallons enters the tank every minute and 3 gallons leaves every minute, what can you conclude about the volume of water in the tank.</p></li>
<li><p>How many grams of salt enters the tank every minute?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that \(S(t)\) denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank in minute \(t\text{.}\) How many grams are there in each gallon in minute \(t\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Since water leaves the tank at 3 gallons per minute, how many grams of salt leave the tank each minute?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of \(S\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>Identify any equilibrium solutions and determine whether they are stable or unstable.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that there is initially no salt in the tank. Find the amount of salt \(S(t)\) in minute \(t\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What happens to \(S(t)\) after a very long time? Explain how you could have predicted this only knowing how much salt there is in each gallon of the briny solution that enters the tank.</p></li>
