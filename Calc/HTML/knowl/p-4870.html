<li><p>For a definite integral such as \(\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx\) when we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because the integrand lacks an elementary algebraic antiderivative, we can estimate the integral's value by using a sequence of Riemann sum approximations. Typically, we start by computing \(L_n\text{,}\) \(R_n\text{,}\) and \(M_n\) for one or more chosen values of \(n\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The Trapezoid Rule, which estimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) by using trapezoids, rather than rectangles, can also be viewed as the average of Left and Right Riemann sums. That is, \(T_n = \frac{1}{2}(L_n + R_n)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average \(S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\text{,}\) we can build a much more accurate approximation to \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for \(S_{2n}\) is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.</p></li>
