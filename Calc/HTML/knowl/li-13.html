<p>Each section of the text has a preview activity and typically at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. As a separate document, we have compiled a workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses. This workbook is the one printing expense that students will almost certainly have to undertake, and is available in .pdf upon request, as well as for purchase for a nominal fee on Amazon.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-4.html#li-13">in-context</a></span>
