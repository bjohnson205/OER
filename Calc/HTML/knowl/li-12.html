<p>Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the text itself. Students can do likewise, choosing to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them. In addition, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to java applets, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have internet access. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone. It is worthwhile to download the .pdf version for local access in the event of internet issues.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Note.</em> In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some available information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-4.html#li-12">in-context</a></span>
