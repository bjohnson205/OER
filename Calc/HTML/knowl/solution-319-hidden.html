<li><p>There are \(6\) equally possible outcomes when we roll one die, and only one of those is a \(6\text{,}\) so the probability that a \(6\) appears when we roll the die is \(\frac{1}{6}\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>On the first roll, the probability of not rolling a \(6\) is \(\frac{5}{6}\text{.}\) This is the same on the second roll, so the probability of not rolling a \(6\) on either of the first two rolls is \(\frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6}\text{,}\) since the two events are independent. If we then roll a \(6\) on the following turn, the probability of doing so in that roll is \(\frac{1}{6}\text{,}\) so with the three rolls being independent, the probability of you rolling a \(6\) on your second turn (the third overall roll) is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exact same reasoning as in (b), but with \(5\) dice rolls instead of \(3\text{,}\) shows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>By simply summing the probabilities to consider all of the possible outcomes (rolling \(6\) on your first turn, doing so on your second, etc.), we get that the total probability of you rolling a \(6\) on one of your turns is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) +  \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \cdots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is a geometric series with \(a = \frac{1}{6}\) and \(r = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\text{.}\) Since we know that a geometric series has sum \(S = \frac{a}{1-r}\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{25}{36}} = \frac{\frac{6}{36}}{\frac{11}{36}} = \frac{6}{11}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>so by going first your odds are just slightly better than half that you'll be the first one to roll a \(6\text{.}\)</p>
