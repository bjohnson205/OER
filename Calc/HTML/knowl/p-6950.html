<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Recall that the amount of interest we pay each time depends on the principal that remains. How much interest, in terms of \(P_1\) and \(r\text{,}\) do we pay in the second installment?</p></li>
<li><p>How much of our second monthly installment goes to pay off the principal? What is the principal \(P_2\text{,}\) or the balance of the loan, that we still have to pay off after making the second installment of the loan? Write your response in the form \(P_2 = ( \ )P_1 - ( \ )M\text{,}\) where you fill in the parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that \(P_2 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^2P - \left[1 + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)\right] M\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Let \(P_3\) be the amount of principal that remains after the third installment. Show that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P_3 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^3P - \left[1 + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right) + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^2 \right] M\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we continue in the manner described in the problems above, then the remaining principal of our loan after \(n\) installments is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
P_n = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^nP - \left[\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k \right] M\text{.}\tag{8.7}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>This is a rather complicated formula and one that is difficult to use. However, we can simplify the sum if we recognize part of  it as a partial sum of a geometric series. Find a formula for the sum</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k\text{.}\tag{8.8}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p>and then a general formula for \(P_n\) that does not involve a sum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is usually more convenient to write our formula for \(P_n\) in terms of years rather than months. Show that \(P(t)\text{,}\) the principal remaining after \(t\) years, can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
P(t) = \left(P - \frac{12M}{r}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12M}{r}\text{.}\tag{8.9}
\end{equation}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Now that we have analyzed the general loan situation, we apply formula <a knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq-loan2" alt="Equation 8.9 " title="Equation 8.9 ">(8.9)</a> to an actual loan. Suppose we charge $1,000 on a credit card for holiday expenses. If our credit card charges 20% interest and we pay only the minimum payment of $25 each month, how long will it take us to pay off the $1,000 charge? How much in total will we have paid on this $1,000 charge? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment \(M\) that will take our outstanding principal to \(0\) in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of \(M\) that makes \(P(t) = 0\) in formulaÂ <a knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" knowl-id="xref-eq-loan2" alt="Equation 8.9 " title="Equation 8.9 ">(8.9)</a>. If we set \(P(t) = 0\) and solve for \(M\text{,}\) it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>30 years at 6.5%</p></li>
<li><p>25 years at 7.5%</p></li>
<li><p>15 years at 8.25%.</p></li>

<li><p>What are the monthly payments for each loan?</p></li>
