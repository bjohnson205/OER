<li><p>To measure the work done by a varying force in moving an object, we divide the problem into pieces on which we can use the formula \(W = F \cdot d\text{,}\) and then use a definite integral to sum the work done on each piece.</p></li>
<li><p>To find the total force exerted by water against a dam, we use the formula \(F = P \cdot A\) to measure the force exerted on a slice that lies at a fixed depth, and then use a definite integral to sum the forces across the appropriate range of depths.</p></li>
<li><p>Because work is computed as the product of force and distance (provided force is constant), and the force water exerts on a dam can be computed as the product of pressure and area (provided pressure is constant), problems involving these concepts are similar to earlier problems we did using definite integrals to find distance (via “distance equals rate times time”) and mass (“mass equals density times volume”).</p></li>
