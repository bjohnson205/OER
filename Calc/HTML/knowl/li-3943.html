<p>In the previous question, we observed that \(75\) degrees F is the critical temperature that changes the behavior of \(T\text{.}\) There are several reasons to think that \(75\) degrees F is room temperature: if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature (\(75\)), its temperature will decrease to room temperature, while if the coffee is below room temperature, its temperature will increase to room temperature. Moreover, if the coffee's temperature is \(75\) (which would match the room temperature), then its rate of change is \(0\) and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-7-1-diff-eq-intro.html#li-3943">in-context</a></span>
