<p>It is helpful to think of the depth below the surface of the crock as being the independent variable, so we let the positive \(x\)-axis point down, and the positive \(y\)-axis to the right, as pictured in the figure. Because the pump sits on the surface of the water, it makes sense to think about the pump moving the water one “slice” at a time, where it takes a thin slice from the surface, pumps it out of the tank, and then proceeds to pump the next slice below.</p>
