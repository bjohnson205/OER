<p>There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the Open Problem Library and around 20,000 calculus problems. In this text, each section includes a small number of anonymous WeBWorK exercises, as well as 3â€“4 challenging problems per section. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in <a class="url" href="https://activecalculus.org/single/" target="_blank">the .html version of the text</a>. Almost every non- WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available <span class="booktitle">APEX Calculus</span> text by Greg Hartmann et al., available from <a class="url" href="http://www.apexcalculus.com" target="_blank">www.apexcalculus.com</a>.</p>
