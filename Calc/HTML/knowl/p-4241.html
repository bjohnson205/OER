<p>We see that we have a natural interest in being able to find such algebraic antiderivatives. We emphasize <em class="emphasis">algebraic</em> antiderivatives, as opposed to any antiderivative, since we know by the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that \(G(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) is indeed an antiderivative of the given function \(f\text{,}\) but one that still involves a definite integral. Our goal in this section is to “undo” the process of differentiation to find an algebraic antiderivative for a given function.</p>
