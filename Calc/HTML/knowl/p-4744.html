<p>Looking at the composite functions that are present, there are two possible \(u\)-substitutions to try. One is \(u = 1+x^2\text{,}\) for which \(du = 2x \, dx\) and \(x = \sqrt{u-1}\text{.}\) Because there is no \(x \, dx\) term present in the integral, this substitution will not work.</p>
<p>A second subsitution to attempt is letting \(u = x + \sqrt{1+x^2}\text{,}\) for which \(du = \left(1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx\text{.}\) Here, too, the needed product is not present in the integral in order for the subsitution to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of \(u\) that is straightforward to differentiate, and \(dv\) that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of \(\frac{1}{x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\text{,}\) it appears that the most natural possible option is to let \(u = \sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\text{,}\) since we can antidifferentiate \(\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\) Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate \(\int v \, du\text{,}\) and that integral is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\int \ln|x| \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \sqrt{1+x^2} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since we can't seem to find a \(u\)-substitution that simplifies the given integral, and there are no formulas in the Appendix that use nested square roots, it appears that the table doesn't offer any help in evaluating this particular integral.</p></li>
<li><p>Wolfram|Alpha returns results that either involve inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions or complex numbers. As such, it appears that the function \(\frac{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}}{x}\) does not have an elementary antiderivative that we can find.</p></li>
