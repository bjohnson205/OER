<p>A graph of \(f\) against \(P\) is given in blue in the figure below. This graph and the differential equation show that the equilibrium solutions occur when \(f(P)=0\text{,}\) or when \(P=0\) or \(P=6\text{.}\) Since \(P' \lt 0\) for \(P\) slightly less than 0, the solutions with \(P \lt 0\) decrease away from the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) Also, \(P'&gt;0\) for \(P\) slightly larger than 0 means that the solutions for \(P \gt \) increase away from the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) So \(P=0\) is an unstable equilibrium. If \(P\) is slightly less than \(6\) we see that \(P \gt 0\text{,}\) so these solutions increase toward the equilibrium \(P=0\text{.}\) When \(P\) is slightly larger than \(6\text{,}\) we have \(P' \lt 0\) and so these solutions decrease toward the equilibrium \(P = 6\text{.}\) We conclude that the equilibrium solution \(P=6\) is stable.</p>
