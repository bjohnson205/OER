<p>For each of the following indefinite integrals, determine whether you would use \(u\)-substitution, integration by parts, neither*, or both to evaluate the integral. In each case, write one sentence to explain your reasoning, and include a statement of any substitutions used. (That is, if you decide in a problem to let \(u = e^{3x}\text{,}\) you should state that, as well as that \(du = 3e^{3x} \, dx\text{.}\)) Finally, use your chosen approach to evaluate each integral. (* one of the following problems does not have an elementary antiderivative and you are not expected to actually evaluate this integral; this will correspond with a choice of “neither” among those given.)</p>
