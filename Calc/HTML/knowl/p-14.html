<p>In <span class="booktitle">Active Calculus - Single Variable</span>, we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand calculus for themselves. This approach is consistent with the <a class="url" href="http://launchings.blogspot.com/2011/07/the-worst-way-to-teach.html" target="_blank">scholarly consensus</a> that calls for students to be interactively engaged in class.</p>
