<p>The mass of a radioactive sample decays at a rate that is proportional to its mass. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express this fact as a differential equation for the mass \(M(t)\) using \(k\) for the constant of proportionality.</p></li>
<li><p>If the initial mass is \(M_0\text{,}\) find an expression for the mass \(M(t)\text{.}\)</p></li>
<li><p>The <em class="emphasis">half-life</em> of the sample is the amount of time required for half of the mass to decay. Knowing that the half-life of Carbon-14 is 5730 years, find the value of \(k\) for a sample of Carbon-14.</p></li>
<li><p>How long does it take for a sample of Carbon-14 to be reduced to one-quarter its original mass?</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes. Upon dying, however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14. Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit. By analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the amount of Carbon-14 is only 30% of the amount in living trees. Estimate the age of the firepit.<span class="footnote"><a knowl="./knowl/fn-47-hidden.html" knowl-id="hidden-fn-47" alt="Footnote 7.5 " title="Footnote 7.5 "><sup> 5 </sup></a></span></p></li>
