<p>While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century and the age of the internet, no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is <em class="emphasis">free</em>. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is <em class="emphasis">open-source</em>. Since August 2013, <em class="emphasis">Active Calculus - Single Variable</em> has been endorsed by the American Institute of Mathematics and its <a class="url" href="http://aimath.org/textbooks" target="_blank">Open Textbook Initiative</a>.</p>
