This text began as my sabbatical project in the winter semester of 2012, during which I wrote most of the material for the first four chapters. For the sabbatical leave, I am indebted to Grand Valley State University for its support of the project, as well as to my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences for their endorsement of the project. I'm also grateful to the American Institute of Mathematics for their \href{https://aimath.org/textbooks/}{support of free and open textbooks in general}, and their support of this one in particular.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2}{}%
The beautiful full-color .eps graphics in the text are only possible because of David Austin of GVSU and Bill Casselman of the University of British Columbia. Building on their longstanding efforts to develop tools for high quality mathematical graphics, David wrote a library of Python routines that employ \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/bi}{Bill's PiScript program}; David's routines are so easy to use that even I could generate graphics like the professionals that he and Bill are. I am deeply grateful to them both.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3}{}%
The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original \href{https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu}{Mathbook XML}, now known as PreTeXt. My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016, as well as the support of the ongoing \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/pretext-support}{user group}. David Farmer's conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original \LaTeX{} source and converting it to PreTeXt; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy. Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help, and it is through Alex's fantastic work that live WeBWorK exercises are not only possible, but also included from the 2017 version forward. Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book's production editor; his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book, including the presence of answers to activities and non- WeBWorK exercises and other supporting material for instructors.%

Over my more than 20 years at GVSU, many of my colleagues have shared with me ideas and resources for teaching calculus. I am particularly indebted to David Austin, Will Dickinson, Paul Fishback, Jon Hodge, and Steve Schlicker for their contributions that improved my teaching of and thinking about calculus, including materials that I have modified and used over many different semesters with students. Parts of these ideas can be found throughout this text. In addition, Will Dickinson and Steve Schlicker provided me access to a large number of their electronic notes and activities from teaching of differential and integral calculus, and those ideas and materials have similarly impacted my work and writing in positive ways, with some of their problems and approaches finding parallel presentation here.%

\chapter*{Active Calculus: Our Goals}\label{preface-2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Active Calculus: Our Goals}
\hypertarget{p-12}{}%
Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-13}{}%
While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century and the age of the internet, no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is \emph{free}. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is \emph{open-source}.%

\begin{description}
\item[{Motivating Questions}]\hypertarget{li-1}{}\hypertarget{p-15}{}%
At the start of each section, we list 2\textendash{}3 \emph{motivating questions} that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.%
\item[{Graphics}]\hypertarget{li-2}{}\hypertarget{p-16}{}%
As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color\footnote{To keep cost low, the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.\label{fn-1}} graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.%
\item[{Summary of Key Ideas}]\hypertarget{li-3}{}\hypertarget{p-17}{}%
Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.%

\section[{The Definition of Function}]{The Definition of Function}\label{subsection-1}
\hypertarget{p-21}{}%
We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For a more extensive treatment of functions we refer the reader to \href{https://mathbooks.unl.edu/PreCalculus/introfunctions.html}{PreCalculus at Nebraska: Introduction to Functions}%
\begin{assemblage}[Definition of Function]\label{assemblage-1}
\hypertarget{p-22}{}%
A \terminology{function}\index{function} is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the \terminology{output}\index{output} variable can be determined from a value of the \terminology{input}\index{input} variable.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-23}{}%
What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a \emph{unique value} that is, \emph{exactly one value} of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-24}{}%
A function can be described in several different ways. In the following sections, we consider examples of functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2 Functions Defined by Tables}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Functions Defined by Tables}]{Functions Defined by Tables}\label{subsection-2}
\hypertarget{p-25}{}%
When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable \emph{is a function of} the input.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-table-functions}

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-4}{}\hypertarget{p-27}{}%
\hyperref[table-auto-sales]{Table~\ref{table-auto-sales}} shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, \(S\), \emph{is a function of} \(t\).%
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{AcAcA}\hrulethick

\item\hypertarget{li-5}{}\hypertarget{p-28}{}%
\hyperref[table-postage]{Table~\ref{table-postage}} gives the cost of sending printed material by first-class mail in 2016.%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcA}\hrulethick
Weight in ounces \((w)\)&Postage \((P)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(0 \lt w \le 1 \)&\textdollar{}0.47\tabularnewline\hrulethin

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-postage}}
\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-29}{}%
If we know the weight of the article being shipped, we can determine the required postage from \hyperref[table-postage]{Table~\ref{table-postage}}. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require \textdollar{}1.31 in postage. In this example, \(w\) is the input variable and \(p\) is the output variable. We say that \(p\) \emph{is a function of} \(w\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6}{}\hypertarget{p-30}{}%
\hyperref[table-cholesterol]{Table~\ref{table-cholesterol}} records the age and cholesterol count for 20 patients tested in a hospital survey.%
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcAcAcA}\hrulethick
Age&Cholesterol count&&Age&Cholesterol count\tabularnewline\hrulethin

48&212&&53&193\tabularnewline\hrulethin
50&234&&48&172\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-cholesterol}}
\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-31}{}%
According to these data, cholesterol count is \emph{not} a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a \emph{unique} value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a persons cholesterol count.%

A graph may also be used to define one variable as a function of another. The input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis, and the output variable on the vertical axis.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-sun-hours}

\hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}} illustrates a function defined by an equation.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book}
\hypertarget{p-47}{}%
As of 2016,  One World Trade Center in New York City is the nations tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after \(t\) seconds is given by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16t^2
\end{equation*}
Thus, after \(1\) second the books height is%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16(1)^2 = 1760 \text{ feet}
\end{equation*}
After \(2\) seconds its height is%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16(2)^2 = 1712 \text{ feet}
\end{equation*}
For this function, \(t\) is the input variable and \(h\) is the output variable. For any value of \(t\), a unique value of \(h\) can be determined from the equation for \(h\). We say that \(h\) \emph{is a function of} \(t\).%

\hypertarget{p-48}{}%
There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\) (or \(F\), \(G\), or \(H\)), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are the most common choices.) For instance, the height, \(h\), of a falling textbook is a function of the elapsed time, \(t\). We might call this function \(f\). In other words, \(f\) is the name of the relationship between the variables \(h\) and \(t\). We write%
\begin{equation*}
h = f (t)
\end{equation*}
which means "\(h\) is a function of \(t\), and \(f\) is the name of the function."%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book-2}

In \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation%

h = 1776 - 16t^2

\hypertarget{p-67}{}%
Linear relationships are relationships in which the rate of change is constant. \begin{assemblage}[Linear Equation]\label{assemblage-3}
\hypertarget{p-68}{}%
A \terminology{linear function} is a function which has a \terminology{constant rate of change.}%
\end{assemblage}
 Many phenomena can be modeled using linear functions \(y = f (x)\) where the equations have the form%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x.
\end{equation*}
The initial value, or the value of \(f(0)\), is the vertical intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write an equation of a line as%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = b + mx
\end{equation*}
where the constant term, \(b\), is the vertical intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\), is the slope of the line. This form for an equation of a line is called the \terminology{slope-intercept form}\index{slope-intercept form}.%
\begin{assemblage}[Slope-Intercept Form]\label{assemblage-4}
\hypertarget{p-69}{}%
If we write an equation of a linear function in the form,%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = b + mx
\end{equation*}
then \(m\) is the \terminology{slope}\index{slope} of the line, and \(b\) is the \terminology{vertical intercept}.%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-linear-function1}

Substitute the coordinates of \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\) into the slope formula to find%
\begin{equation*}

This value for the slope, \(-3\), is the same value found above.%

In the equation \(f (x) = b + mx\), we call \(m\) and \(b\) \terminology{parameters}\index{parameters}. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation \(y = 2x + 3\), \(m = 2\) and \(b = 3\), and the variables are \(x\) and \(y\). By changing the values of \(m\) and \(b\), we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line (see \hyperref[fig-slope-vs-intercept]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-vs-intercept}}). The collection of all linear functions \(f (x) = b + mx\) is called a \terminology{two-parameter}\index{two-parameter} family of functions.%

A function \(f\) is increasing if the values of \(f(x)\) increase as \(x\) increases. The graph of an increasing function climbs as we move from left to right.%

\hypertarget{p-92}{}%
We say \(y\) is directly proportional to \(x\) if there is a nonzero constant \(k\) such that, \(y = kx\). This \(k\) is called the constant of proportionality.%

In each case, apply the horizontal line test to determine whether the function is invertible. Because no horizontal line intersects their graphs more than once, the functions pictured in \hyperref[fig-invertible-or-not]{Figures~\ref{fig-invertible-or-not}}(a) and (c) are invertible.

\hypertarget{p-117}{}%
We have been talking about how to tell if the inverse of a function is also a function, but in practice this is not the language typicaly used. Usually we ask this same question in the form "Is the function invertible?" The following definition explains this relationship: \begin{assemblage}[Invertible Function]\label{assemblage-18}
\hypertarget{p-118}{}%
If \(y=f(x) \) is a function such that its inverse, \(x=f^{-1}(y)\), is also a function then we say that \(f(x) \) is an \terminology{invertible function}.%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-119}{}%
The inverse function \(f^{-1}\) undoes the effect of the function \(f\). The function \(f(t) = 6 + 2t\) multiplies the input by \(2\) and then adds \(6\) to the result. The inverse function \(f^{-1}(H) = \dfrac{H -6}{2}\) undoes those operations in reverse order: It subtracts \(6\) from the input and then divides the result by \(2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-120}{}%
If we apply the function \(f\) to a given input value and then apply the function \(f^{-1}\) to the output from \(f\), the end result will be the original input value. For example, if we choose \(t = 5\) as an input value, we find that \begin{align*} f(5)\amp= 6 + 2(5) = 16\amp\amp\text{ Multiply by 2, then add 6.}\\ \text{and } f^{-1}(16) \amp = \frac{16 - 6}{2} = 5.\amp\amp\text{Subtract 6, then divide by 2.} \end{align*}%
